Rod of Storms
Rod, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
___

This silver rod crackles with energy and can redirect or release powerful electric surges. While holding it, if a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes lightning damage, you can use your reaction to halve that lightning damage and choose a target you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do, that target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take lightning damage equal to the lightning damage taken by the creature.

𝙎𝙥𝙚𝙡𝙡𝙨. The rod has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the "lightning bolt" spell (save DC 15) from it.

In addition, you can use an action to expend 1 of the rod's charges to cast the "call lightning" spell (save DC 15) from it if the spell is on your spell list. If you take lightning damage from a bolt of lightning you call down in this way, the rod regains 1 expended charge.
