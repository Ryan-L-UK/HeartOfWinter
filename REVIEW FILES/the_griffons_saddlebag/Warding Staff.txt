Warding Staff
Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)
___

This platinum staff has a wide brazier on top with a small crystal orb that floats above it. While holding the staff, its brazier is lit with harmless, holy flames that shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage.

A friendly creature within reach of the staff can use its bonus action to remove the crystal orb that floats above the brazier. While the orb is on their person, that creature is under the effect of the "warding bond" spell as if you cast it. The spell lasts until the orb is more than 60 feet away from you, until you're no longer holding the staff, or until you die or are incapacitated. You can also choose to mentally end the spell at any time (no action required). When the spell ends, the orb teleports back to the head of the staff.

In addition, while a creature other than you that you can see is carrying the orb, you can use a bonus action to speak the orb's command word and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see within 5 feet of that creature. Alternatively, a creature holding the orb can use its bonus action to speak the orb's command word and teleport to an unoccupied space that it can see within 5 feet of you instead. This property of the orb can't be used again until the next dawn.
