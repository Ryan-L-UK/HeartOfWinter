💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Rod of Refstrophobia
Rod, rare
___

This heavy stake can magically repel liquids in contact with it and always feels uncomfortably dry. While holding the rod, you can use an action to speak its command word to cause any freestanding, nonliving liquids within 10 feet of the rod to be pushed away. You can use the rod in this way for up to 1 hour, all at once or in several shorter increments, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. The rod regains 15 minutes of use for every 12 hours it remains inactive.
