Scorpion Lasher
Weapon (whip), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This whip was constructed using salvaged pieces of a giant scorpion and drips with a sickly venom. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can cause the whip to deal an extra 1d6 poison damage. When you do, if the creature is Medium or smaller, it must also succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled 5 feet closer to you.
