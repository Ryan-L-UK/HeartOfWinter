Ashen Bloom Wondrous item, rare
___

An ashen bloom is a rare flower that grows in earth that's been charred by a phoenix's fire. Once it blooms, it continues to live indefinitely until all of its petals are removed, even if it's plucked from the soil. When found, an ashen bloom has 2d4 + 2 petals remaining. The flower crumbles to ash once its last petal is removed.

Its petals have a variety of uses. You can pluck one of its petals as part of the options below. Once a petal has been used, it loses its magic.

𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁. You can use one petal as part of casting a spell that deals fire damage. When you do, choose one creature that takes damage from the spell. That target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage.

𝗘𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗻. You can eat one petal using an action. When you do, you're cured of either one disease or one poison affecting you. If you're afflicted by more than one, you neutralize one disease or poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

𝗦𝗺𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗱. You can smoke one petal in a pipe or similar object over the course of 1 minute, at which time you gain resistance to fire damage for 1d4 hours. The exhaled smoke is red.

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗱. You can steep one petal in 8 ounces of cold water over the course of 10 minutes, by which point the water is boiling and crimson. Drinking all of this tea, which takes at least 1 minute, reduces your exhaustion level by one.
