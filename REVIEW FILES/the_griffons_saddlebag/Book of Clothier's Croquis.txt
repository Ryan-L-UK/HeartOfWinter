Book of Clothier's Croquis
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This magic book has only the basic outline of a humanoid drawn on each of its pages. When found, the book has 2d6 + 8 remaining pages inside. If you spend at least 10 minutes drawing a detailed set of clothes on the outlined humanoid, the page becomes charged with magic. A creature holding a torn-out sheet of charged paper can use its action to speak the book's command phrase, causing the drawn clothes to either magically appear on its body or transform any similar, overlapping garment it's already wearing to match the new appearance. The sheet of paper then turns to dust and is destroyed. If the creature isn't humanoid, the clothes fit as best they can as determined by the GM.

A transformed garment loses any magical or nonmagical property it may have until it returns to its normal form, unless that garment's function is completely unchanged by the new appearance. For example, a set of plate armor that's transformed into a leather vest would no longer grant any benefit to AC, but a chain shirt that's been transformed to match the ones worn by the royal guard still would.

The drawn clothes and transformed garments remain for up to 4 hours but magically disappear or return to their normal form if you remove them or use an action to speak the command phrase again. The drawn clothes are physical but offer no benefits to AC. Although the drawn clothes and transformed garments can duplicate the appearance of other magic clothes, they don't gain their magical properties.
