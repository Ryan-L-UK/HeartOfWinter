Angler's Armor
Armor (scale mail), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This magic armor was hand-made by a clan of proud fishers. The armor is made of countless hardened scales lining a reinforced leather jacket, making it a sturdy and weather-proof option for sailors. While wearing this armor, you gain a swimming speed of 30 feet, and when you throw a net, your normal and long range for that net is doubled. In addition, when you fish while wearing this armor, you catch twice as many fish as you normally would.
