Scarf of Snow's Sanctum Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This scarf is incredibly warm and pinned together with a silvered snowflake brooch. While wearing this scarf, you have resistance to cold damage. In addition, you can use an action to cast the "wall of ice" spell from it (save DC 15). When you do, the ice wall creates a hemispherical dome around you in a 15-foot diameter, centered on your location. The wall remains for up to 1 hour, instead of 10 minutes, and any cold damage it deals is halved. When you create the dome, you can choose for the hemisphere to have a small entryway leading into it that a Medium creature can squeeze through. Once this property of the scarf has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
