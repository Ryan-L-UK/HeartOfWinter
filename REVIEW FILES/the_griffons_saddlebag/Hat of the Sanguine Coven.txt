💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Hat of the Sanguine Coven
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)
___

This red hat is worn by a coven of witches known for their familiarity with death's doorstep. While wearing this hat, you can cast the "chill touch" spell at will. Whenever you have 0 hit points while wearing this hat, you gain the following benefits:

• You stabilize or die after your sixth successful or failed death saving throw, instead of your third, but only succeed on the saving throw on a roll of 15 or higher.

• When you roll a death saving throw, you can immediately cause the hat to cast the "chill touch" spell (+5 to hit, no action required) against a creature within 30 feet of you that isn't behind total cover or heavily obscured. If it hits, you gain a +5 bonus to the saving throw.
