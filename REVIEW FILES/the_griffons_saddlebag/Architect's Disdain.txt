Architect's Disdain
Weapon (war pick), very rare (requires attunement)
___

This adamantine war pick is specially designed to tear down walls. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever the war pick hits an object or structure, the hit is a critical hit. In addition, if you hit a magically created object or structure, such as a "wall of ice", with the war pick, you can choose to dispel the wall or object as if by the "dispel magic" spell (6th level version). The effect fails if the spell or magical effect that created the object or structure was cast using a 7th level spell slot or higher. Once the war pick has been used in this way, it can't be used again until the following dawn.
