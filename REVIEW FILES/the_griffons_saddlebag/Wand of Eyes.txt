Wand of Eyes Wand, uncommon
___

This wand's glistening white haft has eye-like veins tracing down its length. The wand has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the "clairvoyance" spell from it. This version of the spell remains for 1 minute, and can only be used to see through the sensor. The spell ends early if you are no longer holding the wand.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from "see invisibility" or truesight) sees a floating, ghostly eyeball.
