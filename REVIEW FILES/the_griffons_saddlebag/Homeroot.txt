Homeroot
Wondrous item, rare
___

This piece of gnarled root has several bulbous openings along its twisted length. Enchanted by powerful druids, this root has a tiny door and a small, chimney-like protrusion from its larger end. While holding it, a tiny plume of illusory smoke emanates from the chimney.

You can bury and plant this root in soil over the course of 1 minute. If the root remains buried for 1 hour, it then immediately grows underground to create a comfortable, wooden dwelling (provided that there's enough room to grow), and a stump appears from the ground where the root was buried. The stump has a simple round door carved into it that is large enough for a Medium or smaller creature to enter. The door appears and opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the "knock" spell and similar magic, such as that of a "chime of opening". The door opens to reveal a tunnel 15 feet deep and lined with ladder-like rungs made of twisting roots. At the bottom of the tunnel is a large, circular room that's 30 feet in diameter with 10-foot-high ceilings. The room is brightly lit by bioluminescent fungi that grow along its wooden walls and ceiling. You can magically control the light in the room by touching the luminous fungi, allowing you to fill the room with total darkness, dim light, or bright light.

A single hallway leads away from the room. Four doors line the hallway, which each lead to a room that's 10 feet in diameter with a 10-foot-high ceiling. Every room is decorated with various pieces of wooden furniture made from coiled roots and other magically occurring plant growth, such as tables, chairs, or a bed, depending on the needs of the creature who planted the root.

At the end of the hallway hangs a single red root. You can use a bonus action to pull the root to cause the hallway to extend upward into a tunnel, complete with a root-like ladder, and create a second, temporary entrance to the dwelling in an unoccupied space 60 feet away from the entrance stump.
