Talyard The Great's Wand of Power
Wand, uncommon
___

This normal-looking spruce stick is actually the wand of a famous drunkard. A drunken creature that sees the stick perceives it as a magnificent, colorful wand that radiates with an awesome power.

This wand has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges each day at dusk. While you're drunk and are holding the wand, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the wand, even if you are incapable of casting spells: "heroism" (1 charge), "lesser restoration" (2 charges), or "thaumaturgy" (no charges). If you don't have a spellcasting ability modifier, Charisma is your spellcasting ability when casting these spells (minimum 1).
