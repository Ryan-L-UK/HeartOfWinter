💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Gauntlets of Eldritch Ferocity
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a warlock)
___

These leather gloves are protected with ancient stone plates inscribed with indecipherable runes. When you hit a target with the "eldritch blast" spell while wearing these gauntlets and roll damage, you can treat any 1 on a damage die as a 2.

Additionally, while wearing these gauntlets, you can choose to create an additional beam of energy and make an extra attack whenever you cast "eldritch blast". When you roll a 1 or 2 on an attack roll made with this extra beam, you take 3d12 necrotic damage, and until you finish a short or long rest, your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage you take. This necrotic damage ignores resistance and immunity, and if it reduces you to 0 hit points, you die.
