Staff of the Magpie
Staff, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
___

This magic stone staff weighs 10 pounds and has the bust of a magpie at its top. While holding the staff, you gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to search for treasure or a specific item you're looking for.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from it: "fly" (3 charges) or "locate object" (2 charges). The staff regains 1d6+4 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the staff’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff as the magpie springs to life and flies away.
