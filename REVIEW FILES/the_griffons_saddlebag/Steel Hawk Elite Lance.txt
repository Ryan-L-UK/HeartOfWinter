⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Steel Hawk Elite Lance Weapon (lance), rare
___

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. As an action, you can thrust the lance in a direction and fly up to 30 feet in a straight line in that same direction. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Each creature in the line is buffeted by a powerful gust of wind and must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet in a random direction that's perpendicular to the line. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't pushed. Once this property of the lance has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
