Bath Potion
Potion, common
___

This bubbly potion is frothy and smells of lavender and flowers. A creature can drink the potion using an action. A creature that drinks the potion has its outermost layer of skin rinsed from its body and any remaining dirt and grime magically washed away. In addition, its breath, hair, and nails are immaculately cleaned and refreshed, looking either polished and pristine or smelling of daisies and honey. For the next 24 hours, any blood, dirt, or grime magically falls away from the creature, and it continues to smell and appear freshly washed. Bubbles occasionally escape from the mouth of the creature while the potion is in effect.
