💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Amulet of Buoyancy
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This well-worn necklace is adorned with the bow of a ship and a crashing wave of blue glass. While wearing this amulet, you can use your reaction to immediately stand up when you're knocked prone. When you do, your speed is halved until the end of your next turn. In addition, if you start your turn underwater with 0 hit points, you immediately rise 60 feet toward the surface.
