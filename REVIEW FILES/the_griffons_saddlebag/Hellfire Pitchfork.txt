⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Hellfire Pitchfork
Weapon (trident), very rare (requires attunement)
___

This menacing, black iron trident is warm to the touch. This weapon has the heavy property and a normal throwing range of 15 feet and a long range of 45 feet. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Targets hit by the trident take an extra 1d6 fire damage. While the weapon is within 60 feet of you, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause the trident to disappear in a puff of smoke and materialize in one of your open hands. If you speak the trident's command word immediately after throwing it, it erupts in a brief pillar of flame 5 feet high instead of smoke before reappearing in your hand. Any creature within the same space as the trident when it erupts in this way must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage.
