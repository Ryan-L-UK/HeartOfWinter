Covolt Dagger
Weapon (dagger), uncommon
___

This angular dagger is forged with covolt, an elemental blue metal that carries storm-like properties. When you score a critical hit against a target with an attack made with this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 1d8 lightning damage and can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.
