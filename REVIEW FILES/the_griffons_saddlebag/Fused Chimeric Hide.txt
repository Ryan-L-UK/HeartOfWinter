Fused Chimeric Hide
Armor (hide), rare (requires attunement by a barbarian or druid)
___

This armor is made from the three unique hides of a fearsome chimera, creating an armor that's both imposing and practical. You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.
In addition, when you enter a rage or use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast, you can take on one of the following aspects:

𝘼𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙘𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝘿𝙧𝙖𝙜𝙤𝙣. Your skin hardens into plate-like scales, granting you 20 temporary hit points and resistance to fire damage.

𝘼𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙘𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙂𝙤𝙖𝙩. You grow a pair of ram's horns. If you already have horns, this aspect causes them to grow larger and more powerful. When you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target no more than one size larger than you and immediately make a melee weapon attack against it, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone.

𝘼𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙘𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙇𝙞𝙤𝙣. You grow a shimmering mane that wreathes your head and neck, and your teeth become fangs. You have advantage on melee attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

Each aspect lasts for 1 minute. At the end of the duration, you revert to your normal form or beast shape. Once you take on the aspect of a creature in this way, you can't take on that aspect again until the next dawn.
