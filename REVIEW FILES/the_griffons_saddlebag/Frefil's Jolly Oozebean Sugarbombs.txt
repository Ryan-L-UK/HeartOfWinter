Frefil's Jolly Oozebean Sugarbombs
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

You can eat one of these delicious, jelly-filled sweets as a bonus action on your turn. Each one comes with a side effect that lasts for one hour and depends on the associated color and flavor of the bean. Refer to the table below when determining the bean's effects.

You can only benefit from one sugarbomb before needing to finish a long rest. Eating extra sugarbombs before finishing a long rest upsets your stomach and forces you to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you are forced to spend your action on your next turn retching and reeling.

White / Chilled Peppermint / Gummy exterior with a watery center : You can breathe underwater.

Black / Bubbling Licorice / Thick, but effervescent : You have resistance to acid damage and can safely eat otherwise inedible & nonpoisonous organic materials.

Blue / Sour Lemon-lime / Pleasantly gummy, but slightly numbs the mouth : Grappling or being grappled deals 1d8 acid damage to the other creature.

Gray / Hot Spiced Mead / Harder exterior with a gooey center : You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

Gold / Caramel / Rubbery and chewy : You gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed.

Red / Cinnamon Strawberry / Thick and coats the tongue slightly : You gain 1d8+4 temporary hit points.

Green / Savory Apple / Spongey center covered with a dissolving shell : You have resistance to poison damage and  advantage on ability checks to escape grapples or restraints.

Yellow / Mustard Currant / Slippery and resilient : You have resistance against lightning damage and immunity against damage from the "magic missile" spell.
