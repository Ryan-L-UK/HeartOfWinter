💍 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Ring of Changing Shapes
Ring, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)
___

This magic ring is made of solid mercury that bubbles and flows freely around your finger whenever you cast a spell. While wearing the ring, you gain the following benefits:

𝙎𝙝𝙞𝙛𝙩 𝙎𝙥𝙚𝙡𝙡. When a spell you are casting fails because of a counterspell cast by another creature, you can spend 3 sorcery points as a reaction to immediately cast a different spell of the same level or lower without expending another spell slot. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

To be eligible, the new spell must have the same casting time as the first one and can't consume any material components.

𝙎𝙥𝙚𝙡𝙡 𝙎𝙪𝙧𝙜𝙚. As a bonus action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to cast a spell no higher than 5th level that has a casting time of 1 action, even if you've already used your action to cast a spell on this turn. When you do, you can't move or take actions until after your next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over you. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
