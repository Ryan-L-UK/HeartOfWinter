Inspector's Silverware
Wondrous item, common
___

This array of polished magic silverware typically comes in sets of three pieces of cutlery: a knife, a spoon, and a fork. Each piece of cutlery has 1 charge. When a piece of cutlery that has a charge comes into contact with a food or drink that's poisonous (either naturally or magically), it loses its charge and immediately begins to tarnish and corrode. A piece of tarnished cutlery regains its expended charge and becomes polished again when a creature holding it is targeted by a "lesser restoration" spell or similar magic. If a creature is holding multiple pieces of this cutlery when targeted by the spell, only one of them regains an expended charge.
