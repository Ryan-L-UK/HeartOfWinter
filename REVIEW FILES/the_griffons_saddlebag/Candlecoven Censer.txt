Candlecoven Censer Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
___

This incense burner is roughly 6 inches tall and resembles a tiny witch. A stick of incense can be placed inside the burner and lit using an action. The smoke drifts upward and disperses through the hat-like cap at its top. Creatures within 30 feet of the censer can smell its burning incense. Incense in the censer can burn for up to 10 minutes.

If the censer is burning fine incense worth at least 1 gp, any creature (other than you) that comes within 30 feet of it that can smell the incense must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become cursed. While cursed, a creature can't willingly move toward the censer. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the curse on a success. Once the curse ends on a creature, it's immune to the effect for the next 24 hours. A creature with a trait that grants them advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell has disadvantage on the saving throw, and the curse ends early if the incense is extinguished.

Each time a creature fails the saving throw against the curse, deduct 1 minute from the incense's remaining burn time.

If you are attuned to the "candlecoven hat", you don't need to be attuned to this item in order to use it. Any creature cursed by the censer is considered to be cursed by you for the purposes of using the hat's properties.
