💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Cloak of Daggers Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This asymmetrical cloak has a ring of silver daggers along its bottom hem. While wearing the cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while in dim light or darkness.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to summon a magic silver dagger to one or both of your hands, provided that they're empty. Each dagger disappears in a puff of smoke after 1 minute or at the end of your turn if you aren't holding it.
