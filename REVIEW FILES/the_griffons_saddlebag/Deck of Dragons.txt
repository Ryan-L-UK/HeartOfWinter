💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Deck of Dragons Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This deck of cards can be used as a standard playing card set. Each card bears one of four types of dragons: black, red, bronze, or silver. The deck is made of 52 cards and comes in a wooden carrying case, which depicts each of the four dragons battling for control over their respective corners. While attuned to the deck, you gain a +3 bonus to any check you make using it as a playing card set. You can use a bonus action to magically shuffle the cards of the deck, tapping either the top of the cards or its box when you do.

You can use each card from the shuffled deck as if it were a magic dart. On a hit, a card deals an extra 1d6 damage to the target of a type depending on its suit. Roll a d8 to determine the card's suit using the table below, or draw from a real deck of cards to determine the suit instead.

| d8 | Suit | Dragon | Damage Type |
—
| 1–2 | Clubs | Black | Acid |
| 3–4 | Diamonds | Red | Fire |
| 5–6 | Hearts | Bronze | Lightning |
| 7–8 | Spades | Silver | Cold |

A thrown card magically reappears on the bottom of the card case immediately after the attack. When you score a critical hit using one of the cards, you can roll the bonus acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage dice two additional times and add them to the extra damage of the critical hit.
