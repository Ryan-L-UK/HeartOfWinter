Locklinks Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This pair of brass cufflinks look like miniature locks. While wearing them, you can use a bonus action to use one of the following properties:

𝙎𝙚𝙘𝙧𝙚𝙩 𝙆𝙣𝙤𝙘𝙠. You cast the "knock" spell from the cufflinks with the following changes: the spell has a range of touch, its knock is only audible out to a range of 30 feet, and it has no effect if the target is held shut with arcane lock. The cufflinks lose this property once it's been used for a second time.

𝙎𝙡𝙚𝙚𝙫𝙚'𝙨 𝙏𝙤𝙤𝙡𝙨. You flick your wrist to cause a matching set of thieves' tools to appear in that hand. The tools disappear again if you are no longer holding them.
