Serpentine Horn Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This metal warhorn is coiled in a tight spiral and sculpted in the shape of a lunging serpent. You can use an action to blow the horn, which is audible out to a range of 150 feet. Each creature within 30 feet of you that can hear the horn must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't move in a straight line, and must zigzag, moving back and forth diagonally, toward its destination whenever it moves until the end of your next turn.

When measuring range or moving diagonally on a grid in this way, the first diagonal square counts as 5 feet, but the second diagonal square counts as 10 feet. This pattern of 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever you’re counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of diagonal movement.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 10 percent chance of causing the horn to transform into a giant constrictor snake in the nearest unoccupied space, destroying the horn. The snake is hostile to you. It shares your initiative count but takes its turn immediately after yours.
