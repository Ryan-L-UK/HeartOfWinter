⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Roaring Whip
Weapon (whip), uncommon
___

This magic whip releases a thunderous burst of sound from it when snapped that can damage faraway targets with its ferocity.

When you take the Attack action while holding this whip, you can use it to attack a target that's up to 5 feet outside your normal reach with the weapon. On a hit, the weapon's damage die changes to a d6 and deals thunder damage instead of slashing damage. Hit or miss, it emits the sound of a roaring lion audible out to 100 feet.
