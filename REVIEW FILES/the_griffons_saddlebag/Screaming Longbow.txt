Screaming Longbow
Weapon (longbow), rare (requires attunement)
___
​

Arrows fired from this sickly and ornate longbow let out a screeching howl as they fly. Creatures struck by each of these arrows take an additional 2d4 thunder damage. When you land a critical hit with a shot fired from this weapon, all creatures within 5 feet of your target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 16) or be deafened for one minute.

Creatures within 80 (unobstructed) feet of these arrows' flight paths become aware of your presence as your arrows scream by.
