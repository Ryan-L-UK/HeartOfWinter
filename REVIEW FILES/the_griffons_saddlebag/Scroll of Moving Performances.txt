📜 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Scroll of Moving Performances Scroll, uncommon
___

By using an action to read the mysterious lyrics on this scroll aloud, your words transform into a magical, enchanting song. You can continue to sing from the scroll as an action on each of your following turns for up to 5 minutes. If you sing for at least 1 minute, you gain a +5 bonus to any Charisma (Performance) check you make to sing using the scroll, or a +10 bonus if you sing for the scroll's full duration.

When you sing for at least 1 minute using the scroll in this way, you can lace the song with some of your intention. Choose up to three creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you that can hear your performance. Those creatures must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 hour. This effect ends early on a target if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it.

When you stop singing, the words on the scroll fade, and its magic is lost.
