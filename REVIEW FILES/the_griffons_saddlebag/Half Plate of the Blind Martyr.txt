.
• 1 𝘾𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙜𝙚. "Cure wounds", "inflict wounds".
• 2 𝘾𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙜𝙚𝙨. "Blindness/deafness", "lesser restoration".
• 3 𝘾𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙜𝙚𝙨. "Bestow curse", "remove curse".

𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚. This armor is cursed, and attuning to it extends that curse to you. This curse can only be ended by a "wish" spell, removing the armor fails to end the curse. While you're cursed, you are blind, but have blindsight out to a range of 60 feet while wearing this armor. In addition, whenever you hit a creature with an attack or cast a spell that affects a creature other than yourself, you take 3 psychic damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.
