💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Glove of the Aegis
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This glove holds 5 charges and recharges 1d4+1 expended charges each day at dawn. When a target that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to expend any number of the glove's charges. For each charge used in this way you can add +2 to your AC for the attack, potentially causing it to miss. You can use this ability after the attack has been made but before any damage has been calculated.

The glove's power cannot be used if you are already wielding a shield.
