Merry Berry 
Wondrous Item, common
___

This small fruit is highly sought after by cooks and sweet-lovers everywhere, both for its flavor as well as its unique sensory-enhancing properties. Eating one of the berries raw yields a taste and texture like that of a rich shortbread: the perfect way to end a day of adventure.

Cooking the berry, whether it be in a cuisine or simply roasted over a campfire, brings out more uncommon effects. When properly cooked, a creature that eats the fruit gains advantage on all Wisdom and Intelligence checks based on smell or taste for the next 24 hours, as well advantage on ability checks using cook's utensils. Your DM will determine any necessary dice rolls and DCs needed to prepare the Merry Berry.

Overcooking the fruit not only cooks out the berry's benefits, but also results in a soggy, bland dish.
