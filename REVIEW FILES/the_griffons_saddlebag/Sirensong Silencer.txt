💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!

Wondrous item, uncommon
___

You can don and doff this golden ear cuff on a willing Medium or smaller creature using an action. While wearing the cuff, you have advantage on any saving throws against being charmed. In addition, tapping the ear cuff twice deafens you, although you can still faintly hear the sound of the ocean (no action required). Tapping the cuff twice again allows you to hear normally once more.
