Ehagan's Moving Ladder
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This small, square platform is 2 feet across, weighs 4 pounds, and can hold up to 400 pounds. While standing on the platform, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to cause it to move up to 30 feet up or down, or half that much if it's carrying more than 200 pounds. The platform can hover up to 60 feet in the air in this way, and can't be moved horizontally except by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if you were climbing.

When the platform's property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, its magic ceases to function until the next dawn. When its magic ends in this way, the platform floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.
