Frostburn Spear
Weapon (spear), very rare (requires attunement)
___

This magic spear harnesses both ice and fire to duplicate the natural destructive force of a remorhaz. Immediately after you throw the spear and it hits or misses a target, it flies back to your hand.

While holding the spear, it becomes covered in icicles and sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. When you hit with an attack using this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage. You can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause the ice to melt and be replaced with flames, causing the bonus damage to become fire damage instead. You can speak the command word again to extinguish the flames and cause the ice to regrow from the spear, turning the bonus damage to cold damage once more. The ice or flames remain until you drop or stow the spear.

While the spear is covered in ice, you have resistance to fire damage. While it's covered in flames, you have resistance to cold damage.

In addition, while holding the spear, you can use an action to cast the "fire shield" spell from it. This version of the spell has a range of 30 feet, instead of self, and can target any creature you can see within range. Once this property of the spear has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
