Staff, rare
___

A mote of swirling magic water circles the top of this wooden staff. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. When you make a melee attack with the staff, you can choose to extend and lash out with the water instead. When you do, the water has a range of 10 feet and deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage if it hits. You’re proficient with this attack and use Wisdom as your modifier for its attack and damage rolls. After the attack, the water shrinks back to the staff.

While holding this staff, you can stand on and move across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground. If you end your turn on a liquid in this way, you sink into it as normal until you stand on solid ground again. In addition, while holding the staff, you can use an action to cast the "control water" spell using the staff. When you do, you can only use the spell to flood or part water as described in the spell. The spell ends early if you are no longer holding the staff. Once the staff has been used to cast this spell, it can't cast the spell again until the following dawn.
