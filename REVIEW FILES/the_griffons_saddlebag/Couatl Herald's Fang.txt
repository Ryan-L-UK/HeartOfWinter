Couatl Herald's Fang
Weapon (any sword or dagger), rare (requires attunement by creature of good alignment)
___

This vibrant claymore carries with it some of the properties of the couatl who either forged it or whose scales it was crafted from. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 poison damage and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target is incapacitated and has a speed of 0 until it takes any damage or someone else uses an action to shake the target out of its stupor.

𝙁𝙡𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝘾𝙤𝙪𝙖𝙩𝙡𝙨. While you're attuned to 3 items with this feature, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. If you already have a flying speed, this speed is in addition to your existing flying speed.
