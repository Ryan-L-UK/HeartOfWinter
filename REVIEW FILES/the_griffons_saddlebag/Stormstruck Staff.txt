Stormstruck Staff
Weapon (quarterstaff), rare
___

This wooden staff has been scarred by lightning and embedded with an amplifying crystal at its head. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Small sparks of electricity arc from the crystal, dealing an extra 1 lightning damage to any target hit by the weapon. The gem glows brilliantly and pulses with electrical energy for 1 minute after you or the weapon take lightning damage from any source other than the staff or while the weapon is under the effects of the "shillelagh" spell. While the gem is glowing in this way, the weapon's extra lightning damage increases to 1d6, and the gem emits bright light out to 10 feet and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
