Halberd of the Peacock
Weapon (halberd), rare (requires attunement)
___

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This weapon has been polished to a mirror finish and is adorned with five ornate gemstones dangling beneath its blade that glow with arcane energy. This weapon contains five charges, each stored within one of the gems, and regains 1d4+1 expended charges each dawn. On your turn, you can expend one of this weapon's charges to cast disguise self, or two charges to cast alter self, mirror image, or shatter at their lowest levels (spell save DC 14). The hanging gems lose their luminance once their charge has been spent.

𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚. This halberd is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the halberd, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using this weapon, you must succeed on a Wisdom saving thrown (DC 12) or be compelled to look at yourself in the mirror to admire yourself until the start of your next turn - sacrificing any remaining movement, action, bonus action, or reactions you may have. In addition, while admiring yourself, you automatically fail any Dexterity saving throws you make until the start of your next turn.
