Performer's Puppet
Wondrous item, common
___

This simple puppet is a favorite among street performers and traveling thespians. While wearing the puppet on your hand, you can use a bonus action to change the style, color, and shape of the puppet's clothing and face. The material is always made of a colored canvas, but its eyes, stitching, and other descriptive details can change when using this property. In addition, while wearing the puppet on your hand and holding it aloft, your voice originates from the puppet instead of you.
