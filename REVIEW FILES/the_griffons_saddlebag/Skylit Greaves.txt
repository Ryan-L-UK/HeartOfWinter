Skylit Greaves
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
___

These mithral greaves feel weightless, despite being made from metal. While wearing the boots, small jets of storming vapor pour from their sides when you move. While wearing the greaves, you are always under the effects of the "jump" spell, your movement speed increases by 5 feet, and you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage.

The greaves have 4 charges and regain 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the greaves, you can stomp the ground or tap your heels together as an action and expend 1 of their charges to create one of the following effects, or 2 charges to create both at the same time. • You summon a torrent of wind beneath your feet, propelling you upward. You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover for 10 minutes. • You summon a battering whirlwind around you. Any creature within 5 feet of you must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage and is flung up to 20 feet away from you and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone. If the saving throw is successful, the creature takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone.
