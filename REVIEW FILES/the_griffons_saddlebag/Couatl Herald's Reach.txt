Couatl Herald's Reach
Weapon (any bow), rare (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)
___

This wooden bow is carved to resemble a mighty couatl. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bow has 4 charges and regains 1d3 + 1 expended charges each day at dawn. When you make a ranged attack against a Large or smaller creature with the bow, you can choose a limb to target and expend 1 charge as part of the attack. If the attack hits, the weapon's damage becomes radiant, and the creature is forced to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, that creature's targeted limb is pinned by radiant tethers of magic: holding it to its body or adjacent surface (if any) for up to 1 minute.

Depending on the pinned limb, the creature may fall over prone, be unable to move, or make weapon attacks with disadvantage while the limb remains pinned in this way. The creature whose limb is pinned by the arrow can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice). On a success, its limb is no longer pinned by the arrow.

𝙁𝙡𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝘾𝙤𝙪𝙖𝙩𝙡𝙨. While you're attuned to 3 items with this feature, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. If you already have a flying speed, this speed is in addition to your existing flying speed.
