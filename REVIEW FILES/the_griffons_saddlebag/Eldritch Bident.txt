Eldritch Bident
Weapon (trident), rare (requires attunement)
___

This two-pronged weapon has a sickly connection to another plane of existence. While holding the bident, you can use an action to release 2 simultaneous beams of eldritch force from it, with each beam originating from one of the weapon's prongs. Make a ranged spell attack for each beam, using a spell attack bonus of +7, against either one or two targets that you can see within 60 feet of you. On a hit, a target takes 1d8 force damage.

If you're a warlock, you are proficient with this weapon while you're attuned to it and gain the following benefits:

• When you make an attack with the bident's eldritch beams, you can choose to use your warlock spell attack bonus instead of the weapon's normal one.

• When you hit a target with one of the eldritch beams, you add your Charisma modifier to the damage dealt by each beam, which deal 1d12 force damage instead of 1d8.

• When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with one of the eldritch beams against a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be shunted to another plane of existence occupied by eldritch horrors. At the start of your next turn, the creature takes 2d12 psychic damage and reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Additionally, if you're a warlock, you can use an action to cast the "plane shift" spell from the bident while holding it to transport yourself only to the plane of existence and location of your warlock patron. You remain there for up to 24 hours or until you use an action to return to your previous location on your original plane of existence. Once this property of the bident has been used, it can't be used again for one year.
