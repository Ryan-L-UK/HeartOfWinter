Sun and Moon Shield
Armor (shield), common
___

This shield is embossed with personified sun and moon designs. The sun's eyes magically open between dawn and dusk, and the moon's eyes open between dusk and dawn. While holding the shield, you can use an action to cause the shield to shed bright light in a 20-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light is warmly colored while the sun's eyes are open, but cool while the moon's are. The light remains for 1 hour or until you use an action to end it.
