Wand of Flares Wand, uncommon
___

This wand resembles a small torch and brazier. While holding it, you can use an action to cause its brazier-like metal end to alight with a "continual flame", which remains until you dispel it (no action required) or until you're no longer holding the wand.

The wand has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the "sacred flame" (1 charge; save DC 13) or "scorching ray" spell (2 charges; spell attack bonus +5) from it. Alternatively, you can expend 1 charge as an action while holding it to send out a flare in the direction the wand is pointing. The flare can be any color you choose, and flies out from the wand in a straight line up to 300 feet in the air before extinguishing. If the flare travels the full 300 feet, it hovers in the air until the end of your next turn before winking out. The flare is harmless and extinguishes early if it hits a creature or object. The flare sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet while it's in flight.
