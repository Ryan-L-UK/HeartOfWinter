Frostburn Blade
Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)
___

This sword's blade is made entirely of ice and remains perfectly frozen regardless of temperature. A single flame licks at the ice from above the weapon's hilt. While holding the sword, the fire expands to cover the weapon's edge with flame, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 fire damage.

When you take the Attack action using this weapon, you can choose to forgo one of the attacks to sweep the blade in front of you, causing a wave of either cold or fire to erupt from the blade in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 cold or fire damage (your choice) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this property of the sword has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
