Trident of the Dryad
Weapon (trident), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This magical wooden trident has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges each day at dawn. Once on your turn while holding the trident, you can use 10 feet of your movement and expend 1 charge to step magically into one living tree within your reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be Large or bigger.

𝙏𝙧𝙚𝙚 𝙛𝙤𝙧𝙢. You can use an action to plant the bottom of the trident in fertile earth to transform the trident into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. Once on your turn, you can use 10 feet of your movement and expend 1 charge to step through this tree and emerge from another point on its trunk or within its branches.

The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of transmutation magic if targeted by detect magic. While touching the tree and using another action to speak its command word, you return the trident to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a trident. Once this property of the trident has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.
