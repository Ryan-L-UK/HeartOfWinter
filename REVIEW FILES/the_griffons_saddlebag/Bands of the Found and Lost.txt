💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Bands of the Found and Lost
Wondrous item, common
___

The compass-like mechanisms adorning the tops of these seemingly ordinary matching leather bracelets remain motionless until each bracelet is worn by a different creature. Once they're worn, the compass' arrows point rigidly in the direction of the matching band, without indicating height or depth. The arrows spin wildly if the bands are worn on different planes of existence.
