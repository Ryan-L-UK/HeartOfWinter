This pitch dark piece of ammunition is composed of densely packed shadows. A creature hit by this magic ammunition takes psychic damage instead of piercing damage. This ammunition makes no sound when it's fired or strikes a surface. It leaves no discernible wounds and vanishes immediately after hitting a creature.
