Master Machinist's Marvelous Mallet
Weapon (light hammer), rare (requires attunement)
___

This immaculate silver hammer is polished to a mirror finish. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The weapon has 7 charges and regains 1d6+1 expended charges each day at dawn. As an action, you can touch an object with the hammer and expend 1 charge to cast the "mending" cantrip on it using the hammer. Casting the cantrip in this way ignores its normal 1 minute casting time and affects an area up to 5 feet on a side instead of 1 foot. Alternatively, you can expend 3 charges while touching a creature's armor with the hammer as a bonus action to enchant it. The enchantment lasts for 1 minute and grants the armor's wearer a +1 bonus to its AC in addition to the armor's normal bonus to AC, if any. A creature can only be affected by one of these enchantments at any time.
