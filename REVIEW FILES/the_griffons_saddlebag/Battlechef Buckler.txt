Battlechef Buckler
Armor (shield), uncommon
___

This small shield is the repurposed pot lid of a famous adventuring party's chef. While wielding the shield, you have advantage on saving throws to resist or avoid taking fire damage. In addition, if you place the shield face down on a pot or similar vessel holding up to 2 gallons of watery liquid inside, the vessel slowly comes to a boil on its own after ten minutes.
