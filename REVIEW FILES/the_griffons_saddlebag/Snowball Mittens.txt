Snowball Mittens Wondrous item, common
___

These cozy, knitted mittens have been enchanted to always bring a touch of winter with them. As an action while wearing the mittens, you can clamp your hands together, as if you were forming a snowball. When you open your hands again, a perfectly formed snowball appears in them. Any snow created in this way vanishes after 1 minute.
