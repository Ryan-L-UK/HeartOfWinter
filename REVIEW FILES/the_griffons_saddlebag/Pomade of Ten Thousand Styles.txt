Pomade of Ten Thousand Styles
Wondrous item, common
___

This canister of waxy pomade has magical properties to it, allowing you to change your hair color, style, thickness, and length (up to one foot longer or shorter per use). The canister is filled with the pomade and steadily replenishes with time. It can hold up to 4 uses at a time and regains 1d4 expended uses per day at dawn. Using the pomade takes at least a minute to use.

Once you have used this product in your hair, it returns to its normal appearance after you finish a long rest. Hair produced by the pomade that's been cut off turns to dust after 24 hours. If you use the pomade every day for a week to make the same changes, the effects become permanent.
