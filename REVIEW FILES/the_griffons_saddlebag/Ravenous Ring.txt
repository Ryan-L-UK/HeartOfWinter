Ravenous Ring Ring, uncommon
___

While wearing this ring, you can use an action to transform your hand into a kraken-like maw and touch a creature within 5 feet of you. When you do, the creature must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Your hand then returns to normal. If the creature fails the saving throw, you also gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt. These temporary hit points remain for 1 minute. Once this property of the ring has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
