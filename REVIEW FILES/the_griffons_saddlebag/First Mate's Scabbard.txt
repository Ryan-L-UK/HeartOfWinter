First Mate's Scabbard Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This emerald green scabbard has been enchanted with the element of surprise. You can use a bonus action to speak the scabbard's command word to cause a sword that's sheathed in it to magically spring forward and strike at a target within 5 feet of either you or a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The sword makes a melee attack against the target (+5 bonus to hit, +2 bonus to the damage roll). If the target of the attack is a creature that hasn't seen this property of the scabbard before or is otherwise unaware of it, the attack roll is made with advantage. Hit or miss, the sword then flies to the open hand of a friendly creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target (which can include yourself) or lands on the ground at that creature's feet if its hands are full.

Once this property of the scabbard has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
