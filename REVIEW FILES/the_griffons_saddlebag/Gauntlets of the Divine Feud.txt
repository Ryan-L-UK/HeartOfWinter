Gauntlets of the Divine Feud Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric)
___

These paired gauntlets are the last remnants of a conflict between ancient rivals, one a holy warrior and the other a grim zealot, and remain linked by their feud. You have a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while wearing these gloves.

The gloves have a total of 2 charges and regain 1 expended charge daily at dawn. While wearing them, you can use an action to expend 1 of the gauntlets' charges to cast either the "harm" or "heal" spell from them, using your spell save DC. Once you cast a spell from the gauntlets, it can't be cast in this way again until the next dawn. Alternatively, you can expend 2 charges as an action to cast both spells from the gauntlets at the same time. When you do, the spells each have a range of touch.
