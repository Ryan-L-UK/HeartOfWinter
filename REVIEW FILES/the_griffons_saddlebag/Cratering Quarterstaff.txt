Cratering Quarterstaff
Weapon (quarterstaff), very rare
___

This thick, stony quarterstaff requires a Strength of 17 or higher to wield. Despite glowing with crackling embers, it feels comfortably warm in your grasp. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The quarterstaff has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges each day at dawn. Once per turn, you can expend a charge when you make a melee weapon attack using the quarterstaff. When you do, you make the attack as normal before slamming the weapon into the ground at your feet. Immediately following the attack, the ground in a 10-foot cone in the direction that the attack was made in shudders and briefly tears apart. Flames leap from the cracks in the ground, forcing any creature within the cone to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and 1d8 fire damage. If a creature that was hit by the initial melee weapon attack fails this saving throw, it is also knocked prone if it is no more than one size larger than you.

The ground magically mends itself following the attack, although faint cracks can be seen upon close inspection for the next 24 hours.
