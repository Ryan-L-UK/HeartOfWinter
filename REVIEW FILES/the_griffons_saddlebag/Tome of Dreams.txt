Tome of Dreams
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This beautifully embossed book is full of gripping short stories. You can read a story from the book over the course of 10 minutes. The underlying nature of each story is unclear, leaving your subconscious mind to slowly process and unpack its deeper meanings over the course of your next long rest. The next time you finish a long rest after reading a story from the book, roll a d20. On a roll of 10 or lower, you take 2d4 psychic damage as your mind is plagued with intense terrors from the story you read. On a roll of 11 or higher, you gain 2d4 temporary hit points as your mind is filled with joy and courage instead. If you start a story but don't finish reading it, nothing happens the next time you finish a long rest.
