Turtle Pack Wondrous item, rare
___

This backpack is armored with the shell of a mighty turtle. Wearing or removing the backpack requires an action. It functions as a "handy haversack" with the following changes and additional benefits:

• The backpack has only the central pouch of the haversack.
• The backpack always weighs 20 pounds, regardless of its contents.
• The backpack can't be destroyed by being torn or pierced.
• While wearing the backpack, you can hold your breath for up to 1 hour.
• While wearing the backpack, you gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn whenever you take the Dodge action.

While useful, the bag is a little unwieldy. A creature wearing the backpack can only stand up from being prone by using an action unless another friendly creature is within 5 feet of it.
