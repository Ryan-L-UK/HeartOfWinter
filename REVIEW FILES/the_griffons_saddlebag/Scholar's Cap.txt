💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Scholar's Cap
Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)
___

This hat carries with it the cleverness and knowledge of many a previous scholar. While wearing the hat, you gain either a +1 (uncommon), +2 (rare), or +3 (very rare) bonus to Intelligence checks and saving throws.

In addition, when it would normally take you at least 1 week in order to research a subject, you instead finish that research 1 (uncommon), 2 (rare), or 3 (very rare) days faster for each week you would have spent.
