Ferryman's Take
Wonderous Item, Rare
___

These tarnished copper coins are always found in pairs and bear the portrait of a horned man on one side (heads) and a rowboat on the reverse (tails). The two coins can be placed over the eyes of a dead, unconscious, or willing humanoid creature as an action. When used in this way, the coins impart one of two possible spell effects, depending on which side is placed face up.

𝙃𝙚𝙖𝙙𝙨 𝙪𝙥. While placed heads up over the eyes of an unconscious creature, that creature is considered to be under the effects of the "spare the dying" cantrip. If placed over the eyes of a conscious creature, it enters a physical and mental state indistinguishable from death and gains immunity to psychic damage while doing so. The creature remains in that state for 1 hour or until the coins are removed. Once a living creature leaves this state, it can't enter it again using the coins for 24 hours.

𝙏𝙖𝙞𝙡𝙨 𝙪𝙥. While placed tails up on a dead creature, it is considered to be under the effects of the "gentle repose" spell. Its body can't be detected through magical means, and the soul of the creature cannot be contacted.

These effects end if one or both coins are removed as an action or are not facing the same direction.
