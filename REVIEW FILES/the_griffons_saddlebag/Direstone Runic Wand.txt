Direstone Runic Wand
Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
___

A rigid stone wand used by the arcane dwarves of the Direstone mines. The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to trace one of the following runes in the air to invoke its properties (spell save DC 15):

洧떂洧또洧똎洧륋롗.You can expend 3 charges to grant 1 creature you can see within 10 feet of you resistance to fire damage for 1 hour.

洧洧륋롗뢣롗섫롗뒳롗.You can expend 2 charges to cast the"arcane lock"맙pell. When you use this spell to lock a second object, the spell ends on the first one.

洧뗶洧똈洧똎洧똈洧또洧똈洧똞.You can expend 2 charges to cast the"shatter"맙pell.

洧뗹洧똌洧똒洧똈洧똞.You can expend 1 charge to cast the"burning hands"맙pell, or 2 charges to cast the"heat metal"맙pell.

洧똀洧똈洧륋롗뙗롗뢣롗.You can expend 4 charges to cast the"stone shape"맙pell. This version of the spell can alter the form of either stone or natural metal (such as iron or silver).

Alternatively, you can use the wand to cast the"illusory script"맙pell over the course of 1 minute by expending 1 of its charges, but can only use it to write on stone or metal surfaces.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into stone dust. If you are not a dwarf when this happens, you must also succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be petrified until freed by the"greater restoration" spell or similar magic.
