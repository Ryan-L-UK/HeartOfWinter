Aged Goodberry Wine
Potion, rare
___

This bottle of thick red wine is miraculously made from magical goodberries and peonies using a closely-kept family recipe. It tastes fruity and floral, with notes of honey and the feeling of a fresh breeze, and is deeply rejuvenating. The bottle comes with 1d4 + 3 servings of the syrupy potion. A serving takes 1 minute to drink.

When you drink this wine, you can regain hit points by spending any number of Hit Dice, as if you'd finished a short rest. You regain 1 extra hit point for each Hit Die you spend in this way. The wine provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day. In addition, for the next 24 hours, whenever you roll a Wisdom or Charisma ability check or saving throw, you add 1d4 to the total of the roll.
