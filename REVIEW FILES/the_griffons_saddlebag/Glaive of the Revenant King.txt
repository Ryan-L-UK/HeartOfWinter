Glaive of the Revenant King
Weapon (glaive), legendary (requires attunement)
___

This long-lost silver glaive once belonged to an elven king. Its impeccable elven make lets it be swung nimbly, despite its size. This weapon has the finesse property. In addition, you gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

𝙎𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚. The glaive is a sentient weapon of chaotic good alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Elvish and Sylvan.

𝙋𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙤𝙣𝙖𝙡𝙞𝙩𝙮. The glaive is inhabited by the spirit of Kelren, the elven king of Imfe Mythse. His life's mission to rid his kingdom of demons, fiends, and other unwelcome ilk lives on inside the weapon. He seeks to rebalance the flow and seasons of nature, eager to destroy anything that threatens to change the natural ecosystems of the world.

Kelren is stern, but honest. He may share stories of his kingdom from time to time if an anecdote serves to further his ambitions. A character who he deems unworthy of wielding the blade, such as a weak or evil creature, may be denied the ability to attune to the weapon.

𝙀𝙡𝙫𝙚𝙣 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙥. You are considered proficient with this weapon if you are an elf or half-elf. In addition, while attuned to this weapon, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with fey creatures.

𝙀𝙣𝙚𝙧𝙜𝙮 𝙉𝙪𝙡𝙡𝙞𝙛𝙞𝙘𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. If you hit a target with this weapon that is either resistant or immune to cold or fire damage, that target loses that resistance or immunity until the end of your next turn.
