Sorcery Marble
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
___

This hollow blue marble has 3 grooves that run along its shell and contains a faint glimmer of sorcerous spirit at its center. The marble can store up to 3 sorcery points and regains 1d3 spent sorcery points daily at dawn. Any creature that has sorcery points can use an action to store one or more of them in the marble, up to the maximum amount. If a creature other than you stores sorcery points in the marble, it can't do so again for 24 hours. You can spend sorcery points from the marble as normal while it's on your person.

A mote of magical energy swirls around inside of the marble for each sorcery point stored inside it. When a mote appears, it causes the marble to split apart along one of its grooves, keeping any separated portions ever-so-slightly apart from the rest, but nevertheless connected.
