Dragonbolt Blaster Weapon, rare
___

This magic item is a unique, two-handed ranged weapon. If you are proficient with light or heavy crossbows, you are proficient with the "dragonbolt blaster". A broken piece of a blue dragon's horn is set at the weapon's center, releasing tendrils of shimmering electricity from its point.

The weapon doesn't require physical ammunition, and it has a normal range of 150 feet and a long range of 600 feet. On a hit, a target takes 2d10 lightning damage. You don't add your Dexterity modifier to the damage of this attack (unless it's negative). You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal.

If you take 10 or more lightning damage from a single attack or effect while holding this weapon, roll a d20. On a 1, the weapon breaks, but can be repaired with 100gp worth of materials and 8 hours of work. On any other result, the next target hit by the weapon within the next minute takes an extra 1d10 lightning damage.
