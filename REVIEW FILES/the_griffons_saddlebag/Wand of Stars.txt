Wand of Stars
Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
___

This antiquated dark blue wand is adorned with a glowing star at its tip. When it's swung, small specks of starlight drift from its end.
The wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand scatters into glittering dust and is destroyed.

𝙎𝙥𝙚𝙡𝙡𝙨. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 15) from it: "color spray" (1 charge per spell level, up to 3), "daylight" (3 charges), "hypnotic pattern" (3 charges), "light" (no charges), "magic missile" (1 charge per spell level, up to 3), or "prestidigitation" (no charges).
.
𝙎𝙩𝙖𝙧𝙡𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩 𝙒𝙖𝙮𝙛𝙞𝙣𝙙𝙚𝙧. While you can see stars in the sky and are holding the wand, you can use an action to call out a cardinal direction and expend 1 of its charges. When you do, stars in that direction appear brighter to you for 1 hour or until you use the wand again to call out a new direction.
