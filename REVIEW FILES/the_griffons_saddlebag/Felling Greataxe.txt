⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Felling Greataxe
Weapon (greataxe), uncommon
___

This large axe has felled thousands of trees since its creation, giving it a ring-like pattern on its blade and a unique enchantment. As an action, you can speak the axe's command word and swing it to cause a large, spectral tree to fall down in a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. The spectral tree vanishes immediately after the effect. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the axe can still be used as a magic weapon.

In addition, you have advantage on any ability check you make to cut down a tree when you're using the axe to chop it down.
