Ring of Eldritch Ire
Ring, rare (requires attunement by a warlock)
___

This cold, warped ring has three yellow gemstones adorning its surface that swivel and move like strange eyes. While wearing this ring, you can extend the finger wearing it toward a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you as a bonus action. When you do, that creature becomes marked for 1 hour. The mark is lost if you fall unconscious or end it early using a bonus action. You know a marked creature's general distance and direction from you at all times while it's on the same plane of existence as you. In addition, you perceive a marked creature within 60 feet of you as though you had truesight, and can see through any illusion that stands between you and the marked creature.

A marked creature appears to be shrouded in a dark, sharpening mist that magically helps you focus on it with attacks and spells. You gain a +1 bonus to your attack and damage rolls when you attack a marked creature, and a marked creature has a -1 penalty to its saving throws against spells you cast.

Once this ring has been used, it can't be used again until the following dusk.
