Gorget of the Holy Soldier
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a good-aligned creature)
___

This magical gorget is imbued with the divine power of a planetar and has been passed down through multiple generations, manifesting a different power for each wearer. While wearing the gorget, you have resistance to radiant damage and gain the following benefits.

When you do, the spell requires no material components and returns the target to life with half its maximum hit points. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.

While wearing it, you always have the "control weather" and "insect plague" spells prepared, and they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. In addition, you can use a bonus action to summon a pair of white-feathered wings...
