Stinkbug Shield Armor (shield), uncommon
___

This shield is designed in the likeness of a brass stinkbug with green accents. While holding it, you can use your reaction when you're hit by a melee weapon attack to release a gaseous plume of stinking fog from the shield. The attacker must immediately succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or spend the rest of its action and bonus action retching and reeling. A creature that doesn't need to breathe is immune to this effect, but a creature with a trait that grants them advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell has disadvantage on the saving throw. This property of the shield can't be used again until the next dawn.
