⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Fyre Shredder Weapon (battleaxe), rare (requires attunement by a bard)
___

You are proficient with this weapon while you're attuned to it. The sharpened head of this battleaxe doubles as a metal lyre, which can be used as a spellcasting focus for you. When played, its notes resound with an electric, tinny sound. Small licks of harmless fire spark from the weapon while it's played.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, as well as any bard spell attack roll you make while holding it.

𝙁𝙞𝙚𝙧𝙮 𝙀𝙣𝙩𝙧𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙚. While holding the axe, you can use a bonus action to cast the "misty step" spell from it. When you do, the mist is replaced with harmless flames. When you reappear in the new space, each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die. This property of the axe can't be used again until the next dawn.

𝙋𝙮𝙧𝙤𝙩𝙚𝙘𝙝𝙣𝙞𝙘𝙖𝙡 𝙋𝙚𝙧𝙛𝙤𝙧𝙢𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙚. You can use an action to play this lyre and expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration. When you do, you release an energizing wave of harmless fire from the axe. The fire clings to the weapons of any friendly creature within 15 feet of you until the end of your next turn. The first target that each affected creature hits with a weapon attack before the end of your next turn takes extra fire damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die.
