This stony staff has been carved into the shape of a castle tower. The staff has 10 charges for the following properties, which use your spell save DC and spell attack bonus, and regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a the staff crumbles into rubble and is destroyed.

𝘽𝙖𝙩𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙎𝙩𝙧𝙞𝙠𝙚. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. When you hit with a melee attack using this staff, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause the target to take an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it's also pushed 5 feet away from you. In addition, when you attack an object with the staff and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

𝙁𝙞𝙧𝙚 𝙋𝙤𝙩. While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast the grease spell from it. You can increase the size of the square covered by the spell by 5 feet for each additional charge you expend in this way (up to a 20-foot square). When you expend 2 or more charges to cast the spell in this way, creatures also take 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

𝙏𝙧𝙚𝙗𝙪𝙘𝙝𝙚𝙩. While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 3 charges to magically create and fling a boulder at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Any target within 5 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage, and if it's Medium or smaller, it is also pushed 10 feet away from the point. On a successful save, a target takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't pushed. Maximize the bludgeoning damage dice against any object or structure hit by the boulder. After it lands, the boulder disappears.
