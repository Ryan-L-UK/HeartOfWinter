⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Doorway Rapier Weapon (rapier), rare (requires attunement)
___

The guard and pommel of this blade resemble elegant doorknobs. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using this rapier, you can immediately teleport to an unoccupied space on the other side of the creature. The space you teleport to must be within 5 feet of the target and must be on the target's opposite border or opposite corner from where you made the attack.

When in doubt about whether a space can be teleported to, trace an imaginary line between your current space and the new one. If the line passes through opposite borders of the target creature's space (including corners of those borders), then the new space can be teleported to.
