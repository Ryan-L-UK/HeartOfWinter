H'rethi Cloak of Shielding
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

This asymmetrical cloak is typically worn by desert nomads in place of more durable armor. Its woven fibers have been enchanted to be like the shifting sand of the desert, shrugging off extraordinary heat and devastating blows. While wearing the cloak, you have resistance to fire damage, and any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. The cloak also has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack (but before it deals damage), you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the cloak's charges to force that creature to reroll the attack. It must use the new roll.
