💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Kraken Band
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

This metal sculpture of a tentacle coils around your arm as part of attuning to it. While you're attuned to the band, it can't be removed against your will, and you can magically transform the arm wearing it into a lashing tentacle as part of your attacks. When you take the Attack action, you can use your bonus action to make an unarmed strike using this tentacle, which has a reach of 15 feet. On a hit, the tentacle deals an extra 1d6 acid damage. When you attempt to grapple a creature on your turn as part of the Attack action, you can use the tentacle to target a creature within 15 feet of you that you can see, instead of within your normal reach. On a successful grapple, the creature takes 1d6 acid damage and is pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line toward you.
