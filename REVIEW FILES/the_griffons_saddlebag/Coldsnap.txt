⚔️ New item!
Coldsnap
Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunement)
___

Attacks you make using this magical weapon deal an additional 1d4 cold damage with each hit. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

This icy whip has 3 charges that are replenished each dawn. When you hit a creature that is not immune to cold damage with this weapon, you can expend a charge to inflict a biting chill, causing the creature to make a DC16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn. On a success, its speed is halved instead.

Once you attune to this weapon, its normally frigid handle feels warm to the touch.
