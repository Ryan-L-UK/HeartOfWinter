Lunar Rapier Weapon (rapier), rare
___

The dark silver blade of this rapier resonates with a quiet ripple, like the moon's pull on the tide. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, or a +2 bonus if it's between dusk and dawn.

While holding the weapon, you can use an action to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. If another creature is within 5 feet of that space, you can immediately make a single attack against it using the rapier. If it's between dusk and dawn, you also become invisible immediately after you teleport in this way, and you remain invisible until the end of your next turn or until you make an attack or cast a spell. Once this property of the rapier has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.
