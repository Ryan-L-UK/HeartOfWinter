💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Gauntlets of Deliverance
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a paladin)
___

These silver gauntlets are inscribed with powerful sigils that absorbs malady and infection. When you magically cure a creature of blindness, deafness, disease, or poison while wearing these gauntlets, you can choose to have the sigils on the gauntlets contain the condition instead of destroying it outright. While the gauntlets contain a condition in this way, you can use a bonus action to touch a creature and force it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers the effects of the stored condition until the end of your next turn, as the condition is passed from the gauntlets into it, and the stored condition is lost from the gauntlets.

The gauntlets can only hold one condition at a time. Any contained condition is lost if you contain another one in order to make room for the new condition.
