⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Void Render Weapon (battleaxe), very rare
___

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the axe creates an instantaneous temporal rift at the target's location, which appears as a brief void in space. The target must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is warped by the rift, taking 6d6 force damage and suffering the effects of the slow spell until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the target isn't warped by the rift, taking half as much force damage and suffering no other effects. Regardless of whether the target succeeds or fails, the rift then immediately closes, and the void disappears.
