💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Lucky Golden Tooth Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This golden tooth fits snugly in your mouth, making space for itself as if it had grown there naturally. If you're missing a tooth, it takes its place and changes shape to match the original one's. Even if you're not attuned to the tooth, you can use its following properties.

While the tooth is in your mouth, you can speak its command word and close your mouth, as if you were eating something. When you do, any nonliving object in your mouth is shunted into an extradimensional space within the tooth, provided that there's space for it. The space can hold up to 30 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 3 cubic feet. You magically know how much room is remaining within the tooth's space.

You can remove the tooth from your mouth or place it there again using an action. While holding the tooth in your hand, you can open its miniature latch to reveal a hidden compartment within the tooth. When you do, anything stored within the extradimensional space spills out into the nearest available space.

If you're attuned to the tooth, you gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom saving throws, and you don't need to remove the tooth in order to retrieve an item from it. Instead, you can use an action to spit out one item of your choice from the extradimensional space.

If the tooth isn't in your mouth, placing the tooth inside an extradimensional space created by a "bag of holding", "handy haversack", or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.
