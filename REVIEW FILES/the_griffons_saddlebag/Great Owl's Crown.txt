💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Great Owl's Crown Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

You gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws while wearing this crown, and you can understand and speak to owls and owlbears.

The crown has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the crown, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to detect if there are any owls or owlbears within 1000 feet of you. If you detect any owls or owlbears within the crown's range, you learn the direction and distance to the closest one. Alternatively, you can expend 1 of the crown's charges to cast the "animal messenger" spell from it, which must target a beast with a flying speed.
