⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Steam Harpoon
Weapon (spear), rare
___

A curious mesh of magic and steam-powered mechanism, this spear's barbed head can be launched from its shaft and quickly retrieved using the attached chain. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Once on each of your turns when you attack with the spear, you can choose to make a special ranged attack with it, firing the spear head toward a target within 20 feet of you. This ranged attack uses your Dexterity modifier for its attack and damage rolls. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet toward you. A Huge or larger target automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Hit or miss, the spear's head then reels back and reattaches to the top of the weapon immediately after the attack.
