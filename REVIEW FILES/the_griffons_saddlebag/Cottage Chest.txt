Cottage Chest
Wondrous item, rare
___

This 1-foot-long chest looks like a replica of a woodland cottage and is magically locked. You can use an action to place this chest on the ground and speak its command word. The chest immediately unlocks and grows into a cottage that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the cottage is empty. When dismissed, the cottage returns to its normal chest form. If there isn't enough space for the cottage or there are creatures in its area when you speak the command word, the chest remains locked and the action is wasted.

The cottage is a wooden, two-story building that's 40 feet wide and 65 feet long. Inside is a kitchen, a dining room, and a large parlor with an ever-burning fire in its hearth. A curling stairway leads to the second floor, which has 4 bedrooms equipped with furniture you'd find in a modest to respectable inn. The first floor has six windows, and each bedroom on the second floor has one. When activated, the cottage has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the "knock" spell and similar magic, such as that of a "chime of opening".

The cottage's kitchen is filled with magical utensils that automatically stir, measure, and heat all manner of cuisine. Any check made using cook's utensils within the cottage has advantage on the roll. When left to its own devices, the cottage magically produces an array of baked goods for up to 8 creatures when the cottage appears for the first time each day and again each day at dawn until it is dismissed. Eating the food within the cottage provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day. If any baked goods are left uneaten, they vanish at dawn as the new goods appear. Any baked good, furniture, or similar object vanishes when taken outside the cottage and immediately reappears inside.

Further, fey and fiends can't enter the cottage unless you choose to let them, and creatures can't move or travel into it using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.
