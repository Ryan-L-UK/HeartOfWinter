💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Viper Bracers Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a monk)
___

While wearing these twisted, emerald green bracers, you can use your reaction when a creature targets you with a melee attack to make two unarmed strikes against it. For each attack that hits, that creature is poisoned for 1 round, ending at the start of its turn on the round that it would end. This property of the bracers can't be used again until the next dawn.
