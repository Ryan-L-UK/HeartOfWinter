⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Viper Khopesh
Weapon (scimitar), rare
___

This curved blade was carved from a large viper's fang. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 poison damage. In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a Large or smaller creature, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 poison damage and is poisoned until the start of your next turn. The poisoned creature is incapacitated. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much poison damage and isn't poisoned.
