Tome of Advanced Fighting Styles
Wondrous item, very rare
___

This book's magically charged pages are filled with detailed descriptions and illustrations that teach unique styles of combat. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, you gain one of the following Advanced Fighting Styles:

𝘼𝙙𝙫𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙚𝙙 𝙎𝙞𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙞𝙘𝙞𝙩𝙮. Your attacks made with simple weapons score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

𝘾𝙧𝙪𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘽𝙡𝙤𝙬𝙨. When you score a critical hit using a melee weapon that has the heavy property, the target takes extra bludgeoning damage equal to 5 + the ability score modifier you used for your attack and damage rolls.

𝙉𝙚𝙩 𝙈𝙖𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙮. When you throw a net, its normal and long range is doubled. In addition, the first time that a creature attempts to escape from a net that you threw, the escape DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice), unless it's already higher.

𝙌𝙪𝙞𝙘𝙠 𝙎𝙝𝙤𝙩. You gain a special reach with ranged weapons called a firing reach that's a number of feet equal to 5 + your normal reach. While you are wielding a ranged weapon, other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move out of your firing reach.

𝙍𝙚𝙖𝙙𝙞𝙚𝙙 𝘽𝙪𝙡𝙬𝙖𝙧𝙠. You gain a +2 bonus to AC against opportunity attacks while holding a shield.

𝙑𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙡𝙚 𝙀𝙭𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙩. When you hit with an attack using a weapon that has the versatile property, you can use the two-handed damage die even if you're only wielding the weapon with one hand.

You can't take an Advanced Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Once the book has been used to grant an Advanced Fighting Style, it loses its magic, but regains it in a century.
