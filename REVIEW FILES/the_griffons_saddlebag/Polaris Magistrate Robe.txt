Polaris Magistrate Robe
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a lawful creature)
___

These robes are worn by the elected officials of Polaris, a floating city held aloft by astral magic. While wearing the robe, you can't be charmed, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made to determine if a creature is lying. In addition, you can choose to intensify your voice at will, causing it to boom up to three times as loud as normal each time you speak.
