Edible Book of Recipes
Wondrous item, very rare
___

This tome of cooking recipes is magically enchanted to turn sheets of fine paper into delectable meals. You can write a simple recipe on one of the book's pages over the course of 1 minute. As you do, the paper becomes aromatic, smelling like the cuisine you're writing. You can eat the sheet of paper as an action and find that it has the taste, texture, and smell of the food described on its page. The sheet of paper takes the place of one meal.

If you add a more complex recipe to the book that takes at least 10 minutes to write — potentially using sensory language, descriptions of fine ingredients, or illustrations of the dish — eating the delicious sheet of paper provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day. A creature that eats from the book using one of these complex recipes gains and has their hit point maximum increase by 1d10 + their proficiency bonus until they finish a long rest. In addition, if the creature is diseased or poisoned, it can reattempt the saving throw in order to resist it. A creature can only gain the benefits of a complex recipe in these ways once every 24 hours.

In addition, you can use this book as a spellcasting focus when casting the create "food and water" spell should you know it. When you do, the food and drink you create can be aromatic and flavorful, recreating dishes from the book of your choice.

The book can hold up to 50 pages. It comes with 3d10 + 10 blank pages as well as 1d10 filled pages containing complex recipes.

When all the pages are removed from the book or you attempt to rebind it, roll a d20. On a 1, the tome bursts into fire and leaves the air in a 20 foot radius smelling like wine and fine cooking. The smell remains for 30 days. In addition upon rolling a 1, the book's tattered remains transform into a bountiful meal, conjuring a "heroes' feast" as if cast. The book is then destroyed. On any roll other than a 1, the book can be rebound using fine paper costing no less than 5 gp per page.
