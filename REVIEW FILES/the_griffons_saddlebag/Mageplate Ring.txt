Mageplate Ring
Ring, rare (requires attunement)
___

This thin iron ring has a helm-like visor at its top. The ring has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing this ring, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 or more charges from it to become magically protected by an illusory set of spectral armor. For 1 charge, your base AC becomes 16 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You can increase this base AC by 1 for each additional charge you expend. The illusory armor lasts for 1 minute and sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet for the duration.
