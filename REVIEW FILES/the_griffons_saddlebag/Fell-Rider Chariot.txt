Fell-Rider Chariot
Wondrous item, legendary
___

This Large, dark iron chariot weighs 300 pounds and can fit up to four Medium or smaller creatures. While you're in the chariot, you have resistance to fire damage. Two sets of floating, flaming reins appear when you stand in the chariot, which are harmless to you. As an action, you can crack the reins downward to summon two armored nightmares that are hitched to the front of the chariot. The nightmares have a +1 bonus to AC and exist until they drop to 0 hit points. You can use an action to dismiss them, which works only if you are standing on the chariot. The nightmares are friendly to you, fight only to protect themselves, and can't be unhitched from the chariot. The nightmares' hitches prevent them from being ridden.

The nightmares regain all lost hit points when they are dismissed for 24 hours. When a nightmare drops to 0 hit points, it can't be summoned again until 1d4 + 1 days have passed. If the second nightmare drops to 0 hit points while the first one can't be summoned in this way, the second nightmare reappears at the same time as the first.

The chariot is drawn where the nightmares pull it, which you control by holding the reigns. If you have a good alignment, there is a 20 percent chance each turn you move the chariot that the nightmares ignore your command and stop in their tracks. While both nightmares are pulling the chariot, it shares their average movement speeds and stays upright when flying. While only one nightmare is pulling the chariot, the nightmare's speed is halved and has a flying speed of 0.

While both nightmares exist, you can use an action while holding the reins to cause the nightmares, the chariot, and any creatures or objects inside it to magically enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.
