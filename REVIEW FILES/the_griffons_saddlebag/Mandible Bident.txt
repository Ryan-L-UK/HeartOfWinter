⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Mandible Bident
Weapon (trident), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This chitinous, two-pronged weapon still shudders with predatory instinct, magically biting down on creatures it hits. Once on each of your turns when you hit a Medium or smaller creature with this magic bident with a melee attack, you can force that creature to make a DC 13 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a failed save, the creature is grappled by you and is held in place by the weapon. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach from this grapple on a success. You can't use the weapon to attack another target while it's grappling a creature in this way, but you can choose to deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature automatically in place of any attack you'd make with it as part of the Attack action, as the weapon's pincers clamp down tightly around the target.

You can release a creature from the bident's grapple on your turn (no action required). The weapon releases a creature from its grasp early if you let go of the weapon or are incapacitated.
