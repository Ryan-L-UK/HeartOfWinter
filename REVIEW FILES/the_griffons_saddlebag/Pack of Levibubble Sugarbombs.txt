Pack of Levibubble Sugarbombs
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This delicious gum comes in packs of five and can be blown into levitating bubbles. You can chew this gum for one minute before using an action to blow a bubble with it. When you first blow a bubble, you float up to 20 feet in the air. You can inhale or exhale air as a bonus action on your turn to change your altitude by up to 10 feet. Your maximum height with one piece of gum is 20 feet, and each additional piece you chew increases the maximum height you can float by another 20 feet. The bubble can lift up to 250 pounds while you're actively chewing the gum, and can support an extra 100 pounds for each additional piece that you chew. If you blow too much air in the bubble or if takes any damage, the bubble pops and you immediately begin to fall. You can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows you to move as if you were climbing. If you fall from a height that is higher than your maximum altitude, you descend at a rate of 10 feet until you reach your maximum height.

You can pinch off the bubble and remove the gum from your mouth to attach it to a loose object or willing creature weighing no more than 100 pounds for each piece of gum you attach to it (maximum 500 pounds). The stuck target begins to rise up at a speed of 10 feet until it reaches its maximum height. You can remove a piece of gum you had stuck and rechew it, allowing you to add or remove air from the bubble to change its altitude before removing the gum from your mouth again.

Once you blow a bubble with this gum, its magic fades after ten minutes. Any remaining bubbles pop once the magic is lost, although the gum can still be chewed. The flavor lasts for an hour before turning bland, and any further bubbles blown are nonmagical.
