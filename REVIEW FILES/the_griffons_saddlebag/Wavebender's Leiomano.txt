Wavebender's Leiomano
Weapon (glaive), rare
___

This long palm wood oar is fashioned with wood burnt motifs and adorned with a line of shark teeth along the edge of the paddle. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding the leiomano, you can use it to cast the "control water" spell. When you do, you can only use the spell to redirect the flow of water as described in the spell. The spell ends early if you are no longer holding the weapon. Once the weapon's been used to cast this spell, it can't cast the spell again until the following dawn.

In addition, if you use this weapon as an oar when rowing a ship, that ship's rowing speed increases by 5 feet for each “wavebender's leiomano" being used.
