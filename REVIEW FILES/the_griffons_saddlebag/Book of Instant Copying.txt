Book of Instant Copying
Wondrous item, common
___

This book has a glass cover and is typically found with 2d10 + 30 blank pages. As an action, you can place a piece of paper or similar object (such as a leaf or patterned fabric) between the book's glass and the page below it and speak the book's command word. When you do, the book magically inscribes an image of the placed object in black ink as it appears pressed against the glass on the first blank page of the book.

Copied magic scrolls or spellbooks appear as nonsensical glyphs when copied in this way. When the last page of the book has been used, you can rebind it with 50 blank new pages using 50 gp of fine materials and 8 hours of work.
