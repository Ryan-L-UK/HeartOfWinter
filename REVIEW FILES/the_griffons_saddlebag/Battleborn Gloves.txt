💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Battleborn Gloves Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
___

These gloves have been worn by generations of great warriors and bear the marks and remembrances of their prowess. While wearing the gloves, your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2 (your choice), up to a maximum of 22. Alternatively, you can increase both your Strength and Dexterity scores by 1. You make this decision when you first attune to the gloves.

The gloves have 10 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 or more of their charges for the following properties.

𝙁𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙎𝙩𝙮𝙡𝙚 𝙈𝙖𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙧. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to gain one Fighting Style option of your choice from the fighter class. If you already have a style, the one you choose must be different. You can use this property to gain up to two Fighting styles; if you use it to choose a third style, it replaces one of the other two (your choice which one). Runes that line the metal cuffs of the gloves indicate which Fighting Styles you've chosen.

𝙎𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙡𝙚-𝙃𝙖𝙣𝙙𝙚𝙙. You can expend 3 of the glove's charges as a bonus action to temporarily bolster your might: you can wield a two-handed weapon with one hand instead for 1 minute. Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of the gloves' charges to make a single attack with a weapon you're wielding with one hand.

𝙒𝙖𝙧𝙧𝙞𝙤𝙧'𝙨 𝙎𝙥𝙞𝙧𝙞𝙩. If you are a fighter, you can expend 2 charges (no action required) to regain a use of your Action Surge or Second Wind feature. Once you do, you can't regain another use of that feature with this property again until you finish a long rest.
The gloves regain all expended charges when you finish a long rest. When this happens, any Fighting Style you gained with them is lost until you expend a charge to select it again. If you use the last charge from the gloves, make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you gain one level of exhaustion.
