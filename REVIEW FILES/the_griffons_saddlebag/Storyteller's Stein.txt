Storyteller's Stein
Wondrous item, common
___

These steins are enchanted with a clever version of the "prestidigitation" spell that reacts when in the company of a good story. Whenever you tell a story while holding this stein, its lid opens and closes like a mouth to emit sounds and other harmless sensory effects that accompany the tale. For example, if you're telling the story of a thunderstorm at sea, the stein can create the sounds of rumbling thunder and creaking floorboards, or allow you to spew illusory flames after taking a drink from the stein when you tell the story of an ancient red dragon's deadly breath.
