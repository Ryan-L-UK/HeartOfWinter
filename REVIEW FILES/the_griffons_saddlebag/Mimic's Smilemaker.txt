💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Mimic's Smilemaker Wondrous item, common
___

This bone-handled brush can clean your teeth exceptionally well, resulting in magically fresh breath with every use. You can clean your teeth using the brush over the course of 1 minute. Parts of a mimic's tongue are used to make a comfortable grip and scrubber. The brush creates its own frothing cleaning solution when it's used.

Your teeth are magically transformed into fangs whenever you finish cleaning your teeth with the brush, and they remain transformed in this way until you finish a long rest. In addition, your tongue becomes stained blue and purple for the duration.
