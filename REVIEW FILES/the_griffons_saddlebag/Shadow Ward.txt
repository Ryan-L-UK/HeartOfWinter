💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Shadow Ward
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

This eerily still cloak seems to absorb some of the light that touches it. While you are attuned to the cloak and wearing it, its shadowfell magic grants you advantage on any Dexterity (stealth) check you make. In addition, the cloak has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dusk. When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to expend a charge and halve the attack's damage against you. When you do, you can choose to immediately disappear in a cloud of shadow and teleport up to 30 feet away to an unoccupied space that is not in bright light.
