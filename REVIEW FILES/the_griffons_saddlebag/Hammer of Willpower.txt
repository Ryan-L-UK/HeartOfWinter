⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Hammer of Willpower Weapon (any hammer), very rare (requires attunement)
___

The might of this hammer changes to reflect your nature, using your innermost morality to overpower those that would oppose you. A creature hit by the hammer takes an extra 1d8 damage for each half of your alignment, for a total of 2d8 extra damage. The extra damages' type or types are determined by their associated alignments, as shown on the table below.

Alignment 1 | Damage Type 1 | Alignment 2 | Damage Type 2
-
Lawful |   Thunder |   Good |   Radiant
-
Neutral |   Force |   Neutral |   Force
-
Chaotic |   Fire |   Evil |   Necrotic

You can choose to suppress one or both halves of your alignment each time you hit a target with the hammer (no action required). When you do, the creature doesn't take the suppressed alignment's associated damage.
