💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Crash and Burn Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

These blocky metal gloves have a small magical furnace burning inside them. While wearing this pair of magic gloves, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls of any unarmed strikes made with them, which deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit (unless your unarmed strike damage is already higher). The gloves have 4 charges for the following properties and regain all expended charges daily at dawn.

𝘽𝙪𝙧𝙣. While wearing the gloves, you can use an action to expend 1 of the gloves' charges to cast the "burning hands" spell from them (save DC 15). When you do, you can also move up to 10 feet in the opposite direction in which the spell was cast. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. If you use this property immediately after using Crash, the spell's fire damage increases by 1d6.

𝘾𝙧𝙖𝙨𝙝. While wearing the gloves, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of their charges to release a propulsive jet from them, rocketing yourself up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice without provoking opportunity attacks. As part of this bonus action, you can immediately make a single unarmed strike with the gloves against a target within your reach at the end of this movement. On a hit, the target takes an extra 2d4 bludgeoning damage. If you use this property immediately after using Burn, you have advantage on the attack roll, and on a hit, the target also takes an additional 2d4 fire damage from the attack.

𝙀𝙭𝙝𝙖𝙪𝙨𝙩. You can continue to use the Burn and Crash properties even after you've expended the last charge from the gloves. Each time you do, there is a 50 percent chance that the gloves sputter and backfire. When it does, you take 4d4 fire damage, the action or bonus action is wasted, and the Exhaust property can't be used again until the next dawn; at which point you regain 2 expended charges the next dawn instead of 4.
