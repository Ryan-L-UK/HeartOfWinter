Wyvernwing
Weapon (greatsword), rare
___

This sword incorporates a hinged system into it's unique design. By slapping the bottom of the sword's pommel as a bonus action, you release a spring which unfurls the leathery flaps of a harvested wyvern's wing.

Once per turn while the wing is released, you can use your Attack action to swing the sword down in front of you to create a 10 foot cone of wind. Affected Medium or smaller creatures within the cone must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed back 5 feet and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If they fail the saving throw by 5 or more, they are also knocked prone. If you’re able to make multiple attacks as part of the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. Regular melee attacks with the sword are made with disadvantage while the wing is released.

Pulling the sword pommel down as another bonus action retracts the blades and wing again. Each time you retract the wing, roll a d20. On a 1, the spring mechanism jams from exposure to grit, grime, or blood on the sword, locking the wing in place. You can use an action to make a DC 12 Intelligence (tinker's tools) check to clean out the mechanism and immediately retract it. On a failure, the sword requires 1 hour of work to open, clean, reset, and reattach the mechanism so it is once again ready for use.
