Storm Thrower Harpoon
Weapon (trident), legendary (requires attunement)
___

This weapon has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon.

The trident has a chain attached to its handle that can be used to retrieve the weapon once it's been thrown using a bonus action. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an additional 1d8 lightning damage.

In addition, this trident acts as a conduit for the sky's ferocious power. Immediately after hitting a creature with the trident, you can call down a bolt of lightning upon it, forcing it and all creatures within 5 feet to make a DC16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 6d10 lightning damage, or half as much on a success. Creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw if they're submerged in water or wearing metal armor. You are immune to the lightning damage caused by this effect. This ability fails if the creatures are obstructed from the sky. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.

𝙄𝙢𝙥𝙖𝙡𝙚. You can use your action to try to impale and pull a creature toward you. If your target is a creature that is no more than one size larger than you, you can make a ranged weapon attack against it using the trident. If you hit, you can attempt to pull the impaled creature toward you by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check. If you succeed, you can pull the creature up to 20 feet toward you.
