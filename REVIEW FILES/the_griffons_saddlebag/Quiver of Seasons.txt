Quiver of Seasons Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This slender quiver is decorated with a forest of silhouetted trees. You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to speak the quiver's command word to change its season, which also changes its color and design: Spring (green, trees with silver leaves), Summer (yellow, rays of silver sunlight), Autumn (orange, silver leaves falling), or Winter (blue, silver veins on trees).

The quiver has 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a ranged attack using a weapon to fire ammunition drawn from this quiver, you can expend 1 of the quiver's charges to infuse that ammunition with the quiver's seasonal magic.

A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach from the brambles on a success.

𝙎𝙪𝙢𝙢𝙚𝙧. The ammunition is scorched by wildfire. On a hit, flames erupt from it that deal an extra 1d10 fire damage to the target. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take an extra 1d10 fire damage at the start of its next turn.

𝘼𝙪𝙩𝙪𝙢𝙣. The ammunition is touched by decaying fungus. On a hit, a cloud of sickening spores bursts from it that deals an extra 1d10 necrotic damage to the target. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of your next turn. This has no effect on undead or constructs.

𝙒𝙞𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙧. The ammunition is covered in biting frost. On a hit, ice splinters outward from it that deals an extra 1d10 cold damage. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved until the end of your next turn. For the duration of this effect, it can't use reactions, and...
