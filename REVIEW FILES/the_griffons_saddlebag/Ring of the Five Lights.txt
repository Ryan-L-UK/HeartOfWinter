Ring of the Five Lights Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

While wearing this ring, you can use an action to cast the "dancing lights" spell from it. When you do, the spell creates five orbs of light, instead of four. You can combine four of the lights to form the glowing humanoid form, as described by the spell, or combine all five lights to form one of the following options.

𝙂𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙃𝙪𝙢𝙖𝙣𝙤𝙞𝙙. The lights combine to form the same Medium humanoid form as described in the spell, but the fifth light appears as a gleaming eye in the center of its head. For the duration of the form, you can use an action to see through its eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, using your normal senses as if you were in the form's space. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. This version of the humanoid form emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. This property of the ring can't be used again until the next dawn.

𝙃𝙖𝙣𝙙. The lights combine to form a glowing, five-fingered hand, which duplicates the effects of the "mage hand" spell with the following changes: the spell's range is 120 feet, instead of 30, and the hand emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. This property of the ring can't be used again until the next dawn.

Alternatively, if you use the ring to cast the "dancing lights" spell, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns for the duration of the spell to send one of its glowing lights out toward a target that you can see within 120 feet of you. When you do, each light you send is a single "magic missile" dart, which deals radiant damage instead of force damage. Doing so reduces the total number of glowing lights from that "dancing lights" spell by one. The ring can send up to 5 "magic missile" darts in this way, and it regains all expended uses daily at dawn.
