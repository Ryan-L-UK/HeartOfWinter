Blue Dragon Horn Shield Armor (shield), legendary (requires attunement)
___

This shield is carved out of the horn of an adult blue dragon. While holding it, you gain resistance to lightning damage and a +2 bonus to your AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. While holding the shield, you can use the following properties.

𝙇𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩𝙣𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙒𝙚𝙖𝙥𝙤𝙣. You can use a bonus action to drag a weapon you're wielding across the face of the shield to charge it with electricity. The first time you hit a target with the charged weapon in the next minute, the attack deals an extra 4d6 lightning damage to the target. Once this property of the shield has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn or until you take 10 or more lightning damage from a single source while holding the shield.

𝙎𝙝𝙞𝙚𝙡𝙙 𝘾𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙜𝙚. If you move at least 20 feet in a straight line toward a target and immediately make a melee weapon attack against it, you can make the attack using the shield instead. You are proficient with the attack, which uses your Strength modifier for its attack and damage rolls. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and 1d6 lightning damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
