___

This beaded necklace can be used as a set of prayer beads or special rosary. While wearing or holding the beads, you can use an action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

If you're a cleric, monk, or paladin, you can use an action to hold onto the beads to further channel your spirituality. If you're a monk, you regain 1d4 + 1 expended ki points. If you're a cleric or paladin, you regain one use of your Channel Divinity. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
