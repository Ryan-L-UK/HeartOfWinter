🍬 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Kindle Egg Sugarbombs
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This delicious, chocolaty sweet is made with enchanted spices that grant the eater an hour of fire and cold resistance when eaten as an action. Once the magical effects wear off, your body begin to shiver slightly, but your tastebuds hunger for more. The effects of every additional kindle egg sugarbomb you eat before finishing a long rest only last for one minute, and incur a level of exhaustion for each additional one eaten once their effects expire.
