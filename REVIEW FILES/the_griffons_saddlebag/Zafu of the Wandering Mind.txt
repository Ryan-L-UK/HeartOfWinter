💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Zafu of the Wandering Mind
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a monk)
___

This soft, elaborately stitched pillow set focuses the intensity of your meditation. It takes 1 minute to settle into a meditation while on the pillows. You can hold a light conversation while meditating, but are otherwise unable to move or take actions as normal. While meditating in this way, you can choose to levitate yourself and the pillows up to 5 feet in the air (no action required). While you're within 100 feet of at least one of the pillows, can speak their command word as a bonus action to cause the pillows to be shunted into a special pocket dimension. Speaking the command word again returns them softly to an empty space within 5 feet of you.

In addition, this pillow has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges each day at dawn. While meditating on the pillows, you can expend 1 charge to cast the "arcane eye" spell, without breaking your meditation. You lose concentration on this spell when cast in this way if you end your meditation.
