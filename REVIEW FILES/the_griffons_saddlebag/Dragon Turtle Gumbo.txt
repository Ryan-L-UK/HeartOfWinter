Dragon Turtle Gumbo Wondrous item, rare
___

This spicy dish is made with dragon turtle meat and an assortment of flavorful herbs and vegetables that enrich its savory broth. It takes 1 minute to eat. Once you've eaten the gumbo, you can breathe underwater for 8 hours.

For the same duration, you can use an action to summon forth the heat and power of a dragon turtle, exhaling a scalding wave of steam and spice in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage. Once you exhale in this way three times, you can't do so again for the rest of the duration.
