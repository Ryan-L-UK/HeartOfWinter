💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Field Healer's Pauldron Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This iron pauldron bears a faded healer's emblem and holds up a rugged shoulder cape. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a die to restore hit points to a creature (including yourself), you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. In addition, once on each of your turns when you restore hit points to a creature using a spell of 1st level or higher, you can grant that creature the benefits of the "bless" spell until the start of your next turn. If the spell targets multiple creatures, you choose one of them to gain the benefits.
