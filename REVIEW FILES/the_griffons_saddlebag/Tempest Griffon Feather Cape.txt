💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Tempest Griffon Feather Cape
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

You have resistance to lightning damage and make Dexterity saving throws to resist or avoid lightning spells and effects with advantage while wearing this cape.

As an action, you can speak the cape's command word and transform yourself into a bolt of lightning. When you do, choose an unoccupied space that you can see within 120 feet of you. You disappear from your current location and travel in a line 5 feet wide and up to 120 feet long to the chosen space. Any creature in the line or within 5 feet of your old or new location must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this property of the cape has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.
