⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Eternal Slayer
Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)
___

This fiery blade was fashioned from the remains of a cursed iron golem and burns with a relentless thirst for vengeance. While holding this sword, flames billow forth and lick up the edge the blade, casting bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While you're in combat, the light's range is doubled.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you make an attack with this sword, the toothed chain stretching along its lower edge begins to whir and spin, spewing flame and ripping apart any target it hits. Any target hit by this sword takes an extra 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 slashing damage. If the target is an aberration or fiend, this extra damage is doubled. This fire damage ignores resistance and immunity. A wooden creature or structure hit by this weapon takes the maximum amount of damage from the attack.
