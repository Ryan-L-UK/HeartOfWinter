Wraith's Garb Armor (leather), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

While wearing this dark leather armor in dim light or darkness, a shadowy cape billows behind you and obscures your movements. While the armor's cape is flowing behind you in this way, opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage. While attuned, you are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with light armor.

In addition, if you are in dim light or darkness, you can use a bonus action to cast the "misty step" spell from the armor, reappearing in a plume of dark smoke that immediately dissipates. Once the armor has been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dusk.

𝙒𝙧𝙖𝙞𝙩𝙝'𝙨 𝙀𝙣𝙨𝙚𝙢𝙗𝙡𝙚. Dying doesn’t end your attunement to this magic item. In addition, if you’re attuned to three items with this named property, you treat bright light (but not sunlight) as if it were dim light or darkness for the purposes of the items’ various properties, and you can use a bonus action to reveal or suppress one or more of the items’ visual effects. While an item’s visual effects are suppressed, you don’t gain the benefits of that item’s other properties.
