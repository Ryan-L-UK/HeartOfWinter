Egg of Primal Water
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This glass egg is filled with 1 ounce of enchanted water from the Elemental Plane of Water. You can use an action to throw the egg at a point that you can see within 30 feet of you. The egg shatters at the point and creates a special pool of water up to 40 feet in diameter centered on the point. The surface of the pool is an entrance to a demiplane that's 20 feet deep and is always filled with water from the Elemental Plane. The water is potable and can be carried from the pool, but otherwise does not spill forth from it regardless of its placement. The pool remains for 24 hours, at which point anything left in the water is shunted out.
