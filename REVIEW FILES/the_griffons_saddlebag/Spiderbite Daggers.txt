Spiderbite Daggers
Weapon (dagger), rare
___

These daggers are made using the harvested fangs of a large venomous spider. When you hit the same target on your turn with each dagger, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take an extra 2d4 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn.
