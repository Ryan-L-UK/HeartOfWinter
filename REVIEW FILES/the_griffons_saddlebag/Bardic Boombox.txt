Bardic Boombox Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a bard)
___

This gilded box is roughly two feet long, one foot tall, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 5 pounds. While holding the box, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. When you cast a bard spell with a verbal component while holding the box, you gain a +2 bonus to that spell's attack roll or save DC, but the spell's verbal component can be heard out to a range twice as far as normal. If the spell deals thunder damage, you can reroll any 1s or 2s on the damage dice. When you do, you must use the new roll. In addition, you can use the box to inspire a creature up to twice as far as normal with your Bardic Inspiration die, doubling its normal audible range as well.

You can use the box as an amplifier while it's within 120 feet of you, causing your voice or any instrument you play to become up to five times as loud as normal at will (no action required). The amplified sound originates from the box. Alternatively, while the box is within 120 feet of you, you can use an action to speak through it in your own voice. You don't need to move your mouth in order to speak through the box in this way.
