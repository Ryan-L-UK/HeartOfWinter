💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Clockwork Earwig
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This 1-inch-long copper mechanism magically coils around and clasps to the side of your ear, fitting as a functional ear cuff. It can be worn or removed using an action. When worn in this way, the mechanism can magically process any sound you hear, granting you the following benefits:
.
• You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks you make that rely on sound.
.
• You can tap the earwig twice to record up to 1 minute of sound, tapping it twice again to stop recording early. You can tap the earwig once to replay the recording in your ear, tapping it a second time to stop it early. Pressing and holding your finger to the earwig while it's replaying the recording will pause the recording until you release your finger from it. Creating a new recording in this way erases any previous one stored.
.
• You can speak the earwig's command word as an action to cast the "comprehend languages" spell from it. The spell ends early if you remove the earwig. This property of the earwig can't be used again until the next dawn.
