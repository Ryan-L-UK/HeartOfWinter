Nightstalker's Mask
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This demon-faced mask has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dusk. While wearing the mask, you can expend 1 of its charges when you take the Hide action to become invisible until the end of your next turn. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell. If you make an attack against a creature while invisible in this way and hit, the target takes an extra 1d10 psychic damage.
