💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Guardian's Reliquary
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature missing an arm)
___

This ornate prosthetic arm is a reliquary set with glass windows, revealing the suspended skeletal hand and arm of a saint devoted to protecting others. The prosthesis attaches to your arm at the elbow or the shoulder, and it can't be removed against your will as long as you're attuned to it. To attune to this item, you must hold it against your arm for the entire attunement period. While attuned to the prosthesis, you can use an action to remove or reattach it. The prosthetic is a fully capable part of your body.

While the prosthesis is attached, you gain a +3 bonus to saving throws. As a bonus action, you can touch a creature to transfer this bonus to it. When you do, the bonus remains on that creature, instead of you, for 1 minute, until it dies, or until you use a bonus action to return the bonus to yourself.

In addition, the prosthetic has 10 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it: "greater restoration" (5 charges), "lesser restoration" (2 charges), "protection from evil and good" (1 charge), "remove curse" (3 charges), or "warding bond" (2 charges). The prosthetic regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

𝙁𝙞𝙣𝙖𝙡 𝙎𝙖𝙘𝙧𝙞𝙛𝙞𝙘𝙚. As an action, you can use the prosthetic to cast either "mass heal" or "true resurrection". When you do, the prosthetic releases a massive burst of divine light as the bones inside it are destroyed. The prosthetic then loses all its properties, but it can still be used as a magical prosthetic that functions as a fully capable part of your body and no longer requires attunement.
