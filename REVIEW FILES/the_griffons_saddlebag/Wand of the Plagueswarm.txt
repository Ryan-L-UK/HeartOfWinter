Wand of the Plagueswarm Wand, very rare (requires attunement)
___

This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand dissolves into a fetid slime that sizzles and evaporates, destroying the wand and leaving behind a stain that can never be cleaned.

𝙎𝙥𝙚𝙡𝙡𝙨. While holding the wand, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 16): "bestow curse" (1 charge), "blight" (2 charges), "conjure animals" (1 charge; summons two giant toads or four giant frogs), "contagion" (3 charges), "darkness" (1 charge), "harm" (4 charges), "ice storm" (2 charges), or "insect plague" (3 charges). These versions of the "bestow curse" and "contagion" spells have a range of 30 feet, instead of touch.

𝙀𝙣𝙙𝙡𝙚𝙨𝙨 𝙋𝙡𝙖𝙜𝙪𝙚𝙨. Whenever your concentration ends on a spell that you cast from the wand, you can immediately use your reaction to cast a different spell from it that also requires concentration, provided you're still holding the wand. You must expend the respective number of charges to cast the spell, as normal.

𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚. This curse is only revealed if the wand is destroyed as a result of expending its last charge, extending the curse to you when that happens. You can end your attunement to this wand as normal, even though it's cursed. While you're cursed, you are also diseased. Only a "wish" spell can end this curse and disease. While diseased, you have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws, and you must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence check whenever you attempt to use a magic item property. On a failed save, your action to use the item is wasted. For example, casting a spell from a wand would be considered as using one of its properties, but attacking with a "+1 longsword" wouldn't.
