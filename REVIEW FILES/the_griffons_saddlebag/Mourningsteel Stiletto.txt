Mourningsteel Stiletto Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement)
___

This narrow, finely serrated blade is made of mourningsteel, a metal that's been tinged with the blood of countless fallen warriors. The first creature you hit with this weapon on each of your turns takes an extra 1d4 necrotic damage from the attack, and it takes a penalty to the first saving throw that it makes before the start of your next turn. The penalty is equal to the necrotic damage dealt in this way. A creature is immune to this effect if it is a construct, undead, or has legendary actions.
