Shade and Shine Weapon (handaxe), legendary (requires attunement)
___

These two axes are magically bound and count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons, which return to your open hand after you make a ranged attack with them. If the two axes are separated and you are holding one of them, you can use a bonus action to cause the other one to teleport and reappear in your open hand or at your feet (your choice each time).

When you make an opportunity attack using the axes, you can make two attacks against the provoking creature instead of one, once with each axe.

For the duration, any creature within 10 feet of you that attacks you immediately takes 2d6 radiant damage, as blades of pure radiance appear in a flash of light and strike it. In addition, your attacks with "Shade and Shine" deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage to any target you hit with them. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
