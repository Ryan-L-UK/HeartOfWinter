Eyedrops of Clarity
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This eyedropper is stoppered with a cork at the opening of its spherical top, which is designed in the likeness of an eye. When found, the eyedropper contains 1d4 + 2 doses of magical solution. When uncorked, the solution inside begins to drip from the eyedropper. A creature can use its action to uncork and apply 1 dose of the eyedrops to itself or another willing creature that it can see within reach, stoppering the eyedropper again once finished. A blinded creature that has eyes and receives a dose of the eyedrops ceases to be blinded. In addition, that creature gains darkvision out to a range of 30 feet and has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight for 1 hour. If the creature already has darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet for the duration.
