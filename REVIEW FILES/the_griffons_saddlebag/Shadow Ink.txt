💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Shadow Ink
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

Once penned, this special ink can only be seen and read in total darkness. When in darkness, any written or tattooed words, illustrations, or other marks made with this ink glow with a soft colored light. The normally invisible ink, while magic in nature, is undetectable by arcane means unless targeted by a detect magic spell cast with a 5th-level spell slot or higher. One bottle of shadow ink has enough ink to fill 10 pages with writing, illustrations, or other such markings.
