Snake Oil Potion, rarity varies
___

"Snake oil" is an unreliable concoction of alchemy, druidic knowledge, and luck. When found, the potion's rarity is random: Common (90 percent) or Rare (10 percent). Only an "identify" spell or similar magic can determine the rarity of the potion.

When you use an action to drink the potion, roll a d6 to determine its effects based on the rarity of the potion. Unless it says otherwise, an effect remains for 1 hour. If the potion is a rare variant, it gains both the Common and Rare effects of the potion.

d6 | Common | Rare —
1 | Nothing happens.| —
-
2| Your eyes become yellow and reptilian. | You have blindsight out to a range of 10 feet for 1d4 hours.
-
3| Your tongue becomes forked. | You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell for 24 hours.
-
4| Your skin becomes scaled, like a snake. | You have resistance to poison and acid damage.
-
5| Your footsteps create gentle rattling noises. | You gain the benefits of the "freedom of movement" spell.
-
6| Whenever you make an "S" sound, it's pronounced like a hiss.| You grow snakelike fangs. You can use a bonus action to make a bite attack using these fangs. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage, plus an extra 2d8 poison damage.
