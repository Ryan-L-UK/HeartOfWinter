Silken Socks of Slickening
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This pair of magical, smooth socks are iridescent and feel cool to the touch. While wearing both socks on your feet, you can use them to cast the "grease" spell as an action (spell save DC 14). When you do, the spell targets a 10-foot square area adjacent to you. The magical oil runs off the socks to the ground at your feet, causing the ground to become slick. This property of the socks can't be used again until the next dawn.
