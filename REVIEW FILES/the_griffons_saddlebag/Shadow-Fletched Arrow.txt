Shadow-Fletched Arrow Weapon (arrow), rare
___

This arrow is barbed with unforgiving spikes and releases a plume of magical shadow when shot. When a creature is hit by the arrow, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A creature's Strength score is reduced by 2d4 for 1 hour on a failed save, or by half as much on a successful one. This effect can't reduce a creature's Strength score below 6. The arrow then becomes nonmagical.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as "shadow-fletched bolts" meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.
