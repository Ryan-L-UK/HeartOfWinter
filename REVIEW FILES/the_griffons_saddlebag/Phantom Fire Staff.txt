Phantom Fire Staff Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)
___

This wooden staff is made from the gnarled branch of a tree. While holding it, a swirling blue flame appears at the center of its burnt, claw-shaped head. The flame sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While the fire burns, will-o'-wisps are indifferent toward any creature within the flame's bright light and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. You can use a bonus action while holding the staff to snuff out the light or rekindle it.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the "invisibility" or "scorching ray" spell from it, using your spell attack bonus. For 1 charge, you cast the 2nd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

Once on each of your turns when you hit the same creature with three or more rays from the same "scorching ray" spell from the staff, you can choose to force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature becomes affected by the "phantasmal killer" spell as if you cast it, requiring you to concentrate on the effect as normal. This version of the spell creates a nightmare of hellish, all-consuming flames that are only visible to the affected creature. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points due to this damage from "phantasmal killer", you regain 10 hit points.

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes in a plume of blue fire, destroying it, and emits a ghostly, disembodied laugh.
