Sir Varion's Lance
Weapon (lance), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This weighty lance was originally designed for Sir Varion, a brave knight with a famous disregard for horses. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This weapon has the heavy property, but is uniquely balanced to function well in close-quarters combat. Attacking a target within 5 feet of you with this weapon doesn't impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

If you are attuned to "Sir Varion's shield", you can wield this weapon with one hand, instead of two, while also holding the shield.
