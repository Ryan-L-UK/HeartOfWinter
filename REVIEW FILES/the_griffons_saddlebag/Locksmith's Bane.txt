💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Locksmith's Bane
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This silver lock pick twists and reorients itself to more easily open locks. You gain a +3 bonus on ability checks you make with this tool in order to pick open a lock. If you roll a 1 on an ability check in this way, the pick casts the "knock" spell on the lock before it disintegrates into a silver dust.

If you roll a 1 in this way and use an ability to reroll the die or otherwise change the result, the item becomes a nonmagical, mundane lock pick but does not cast the spell or disintegrate.
