Rat King Rapier Weapon (rapier), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This dark silver rapier is detailed with rat illustrations along its handle. Bands of metal forged in the likeness of rat tails form its twisted guard. While the rapier is on your person, ordinary rats, giant rats, and swarms of rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.

In addition, when you attack a creature with this magic rapier and have advantage on the attack roll, the target takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage on a hit. You can deal this extra damage only once on each of your turns.

𝙈𝙖𝙧𝙠 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙍𝙖𝙩 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜. While you're attuned to one or more other items with "rat king" in its name, the rapier gains the following additional property.

When you roll a 1 or 2 on the bonus piercing damage die, you can reroll the die. You must use the new roll, even if it is a 1 or a 2.
