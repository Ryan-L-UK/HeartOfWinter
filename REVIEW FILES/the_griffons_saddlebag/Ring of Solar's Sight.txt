💍 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Ring of Solar's Sight
Ring, rare (requires attunement)
___

This gilded ring has 4 charges and regains 1d3 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the "hunter's mark" spell from it, which lasts for 1 minute. You gain a +2 bonus to weapon attack rolls made against any target you mark with the spell in this way, and on a hit, the attack deals radiant damage instead of the weapon's normal damage type.
