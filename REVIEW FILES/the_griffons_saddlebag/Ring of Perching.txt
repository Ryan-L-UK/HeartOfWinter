💍 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Ring of Perching Ring, common
___

This copper ring is twisted to look like a wooden branch and oxidized in places to color its leaves green. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to hold the finger wearing it aloft and whistle the ring's command melody. When you do, the nearest harmless Tiny bird within 60 feet of you flies to your outstretched finger and perches there. The bird is not magically bound to your finger and can fly away again at its discretion. However, you gain a +1d4 bonus to any Wisdom (Animal Handling) check you make to interact with a bird perched on your finger in this way.
