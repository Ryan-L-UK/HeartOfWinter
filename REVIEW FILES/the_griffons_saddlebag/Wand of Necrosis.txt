Wand of Necrosis
Wand, very rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)
___

This gnarled, wooden branch has grown over one of the severed fingers of a powerful lich, creating a gruesome and deadly wand. The wand has 7 charges. If the wand has at least 1 charge remaining, you have resistance to necrotic damage while you hold it.

While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 15, attack bonus +7): "blight" (4 charges), finger of death (7 charges), "inflict wounds" (1 charge per spell level, plus 1 additional charge to make its range 30 feet), or "ray of enfeeblement" (2 charges).

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand explodes, destroying the wand in a flash of green light that duplicates the effect of the "finger of death" spell, targeting only you. If you become a zombie as a result of this effect, you are under the command of the nearest lich within 100 miles of you, if any.
