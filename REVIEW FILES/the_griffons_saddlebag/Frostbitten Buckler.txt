Frostbitten Buckler
Armor (shield), uncommon
___

This icy shield has three charges that recharge each dawn. When a creature you can see hits you with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a charge using a reaction (after receiving the damage) to deal 2d4 cold damage back to the attacker, granting you that same amount of damage as temporary hit points for up to one minute.
