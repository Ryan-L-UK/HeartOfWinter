Battlechef's Splendid Saucepan
Wondrous item, very rare
___

This magic saucepan can be used to turn nearly anything into a delicious and filling meal. You can boil 1 pound of any one or combination of organic, nonmagical materials for 10 minutes or longer to magically transform them into a stew that can feed up to 4 creatures for 24 hours.

The saucepan also functions as a mace, granting you +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. Any target that's wearing metal armor or made of stone, metal, or similarly hard material takes an extra 1d4 thunder damage whenever they're hit by the saucepan as the weapon rings from the impact.

If you're not wearing heavy armor, you can don or doff the saucepan as a helmet as an action. While wearing the saucepan in this way, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.
