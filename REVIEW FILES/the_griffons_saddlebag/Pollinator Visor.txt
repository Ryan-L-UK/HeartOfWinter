💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Pollinator Visor
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)
___

This chitinous mask rests over your ears and can be raised or lowered using an action to sit on top of your head or in front of your eyes. The mask has two large, eye-like lenses that improve your vision and allow you to visualize scents. While wearing the mask over your eyes, you gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and smell.
The mask has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the mask over your eyes, you can expend 1 of its charges as an action to cast the "animal messenger" spell from it, targeting a Tiny insect or similar creature within range, such as a centipede, spider, wasp, or scorpion. When cast in this way, the insect covers about 25 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 12 miles for other insects.

𝘽𝙚𝙚𝙠𝙚𝙚𝙥𝙚𝙧'𝙨 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙢𝙞𝙩𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩. While you are attuned to three magic items that have this named property, the mask regains all expended charges daily at dawn, instead of 1d3, and gains the following benefit:

𝘽𝙪𝙜. When you use the mask to cast the "animal messenger" spell, you can direct the insect to surreptitiously follow the spell's recipient for the duration instead. When you do, you must also provide the insect with a trigger word or phrase. When the recipient speaks the trigger word or phrase, the insect magically begins to record the following words spoken by the recipient and any other creature it's speaking to. The insect can record up to 25 total words in this way, or up to 6 second's worth of other sounds. Once it has a recording, you hear it in your mind as the insect magically communicates it to you across any distance, provided that you're on the same plane of existence. The message replicates the sound of any recorded creature's voice. The spell then ends, and the insect makes its way back to where you cast the spell.
