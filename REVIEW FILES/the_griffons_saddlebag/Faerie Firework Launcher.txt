⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Faerie Firework Launcher Weapon (crossbow, light or heavy), rare (requires attunement)
___

This crossbow's wood shifts from golden yellows to vibrant reds and has a dimly lit fuse at its top. It has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend 1 of the weapon's charges once on each of your turns when you make a ranged attack roll with it. When you do, the bolt sizzles and sparks with festive colors, and whistles loudly as it flies through the air. On a hit, the target takes an extra 2d10 fire damage. Hit or miss, the bolt then explodes in an eruption of magical fireworks. The target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 fire damage and be under the effects of the "faerie fire" spell until the start of your next turn (no concentration required). The whistling bolt and firework's explosion can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. The bolt is then destroyed, provided it wasn't magical.
