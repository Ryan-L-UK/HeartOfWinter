💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Meta Mantle
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer)
___

This short scarlet robe's interior and sleeves hold hundreds of arcane runes that have been embroidered with platinum thread. While wearing the robes, you can change your known Metamagic options whenever you finish a long rest. In addition, you gain the following three Metamagic options to choose from.

𝘿𝙚𝙡𝙖𝙮𝙚𝙙 𝙎𝙥𝙚𝙡𝙡. When you take the Ready action to ready a spell that targets a point within its range, you can spend 3 sorcery points to choose a point you can see within that spell's range. Readying this spell doesn't require concentration, can be released as a reaction within 1 minute, and when the spell is released, it targets the chosen point (even if you can no longer see it) and is cast as though you were in the same space as when you took the Ready action. A spell readied in this way fades and has no effect if it's not released within 1 minute. You can only have one spell readied at a time in this way.

𝙀𝙢𝙚𝙧𝙜𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙮 𝙎𝙥𝙚𝙡𝙡. When a creature hits you with an attack or you take damage, you can use your reaction and spend 6 sorcery points to cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action or bonus action.

𝙀𝙭𝙥𝙖𝙣𝙙𝙚𝙙 𝙎𝙥𝙚𝙡𝙡. When you cast a spell that affects an area such as a line, cone, or sphere, you can spend 2 sorcery points to increase its area of affect. A line's length increases by 15 feet, a cone's size increases by 5 feet, a cube's size increases by 5 feet on a side, a sphere's radius increases by 5 feet, and a cylinder's diameter or height increases by 5 feet or 10 feet, respectively (your choice).
