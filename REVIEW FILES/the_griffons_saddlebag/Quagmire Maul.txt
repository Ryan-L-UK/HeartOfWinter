Quagmire Maul
Weapon (maul), very rare (requires attunement)
___

This old, withered hammer seemingly belongs in a swamp. Regardless of the conditions the hammer is kept in, it is always damp and smells of bog water. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This hammer has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges each day at dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 or more of the hammer's charges to slam it into the ground and transform the area around you into sickly, swamp-like terrain that remains for 1 minute. When you do, choose a space within 5 feet of you. You create a swamp that fills that space and adjacent spaces in a 5-foot radius with a thick muck up to 1 foot deep. For each additional expended charge after the first, the radius of the swamp increased by 5 feet. This area is considered difficult terrain. While you're holding the hammer, you can traverse the magical swamp as if it were normal terrain.

If you expend the last charge from the hammer, roll a d20. On a 1, the hammer turns to a viscous muck in your hands and is destroyed.
