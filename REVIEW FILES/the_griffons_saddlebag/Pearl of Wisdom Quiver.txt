💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Pearl of Wisdom Quiver
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This magical quiver is made from the shell of an enormous oyster. Arrows that you pull from this quiver are considered magical, and are coated with a pearlescent, hydrophobic coating that allows you to fire easily through the water. Ranged weapon attacks made with these arrows ignore the normal penalties of underwater fighting. The magic fades from the arrows when held by a creature other than you or after it hits or misses its target. In addition, you can reach into the quiver and speak its command word to magically produce a single pearl. You can hold onto this pearl or give it to another creature. When a creature who has the pearl makes an ability check that uses Wisdom or attempts a Wisdom saving throw, they can choose to use the pearl to gain advantage on the roll, causing the pearl to lose its luster and disintegrate. The pearl is visibly magical and disintegrates on its own after 24 hours if left unused. Once the quiver produces a pearl, it cannot produce another one until the following dawn.
