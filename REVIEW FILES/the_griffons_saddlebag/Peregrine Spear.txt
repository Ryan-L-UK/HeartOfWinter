⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Peregrine Spear
Weapon (spear), rare
___

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic spear. When you make a ranged attack with this spear, you can speak its command word to cause the weapon to soar through the air straight toward the target and magically build momentum. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet the spear flew before hitting it, up to a maximum of 12d4 extra damage. Hit or miss, the spear flies back to your hand immediately after the attack, and this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
