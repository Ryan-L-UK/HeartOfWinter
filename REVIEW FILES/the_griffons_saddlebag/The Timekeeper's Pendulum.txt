⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
The Timekeeper's Pendulum Weapon (greataxe), legendary (requires attunement)
___

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding it, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word. When you do, you are affected by the "haste" spell, which lasts until the start of your next turn. At the start of your next turn, roll a d20. On a 1–10, you are affected by the "slow" spell, or the "haste" spell on an 11–20. The spell lasts until the start of your next turn, at which point you roll the d20 again. Continue to roll the d20 at the start of each of your turns in this way for 1 minute, gaining the effects of either the "haste" or "slow" spell each turn, or until you end it using a bonus action. This property of the axe can't be used again until the next dawn.

In addition, when you roll a 1 or 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you are immediately affected by either the "slow" or "haste" spell, respectively. The spell lasts until the start of your next turn; if you are already affected by one of the spells, it's replaced by this one for the duration.

These spells don't require concentration, but the effect ends early if you start your turn without holding the axe or if you're reduced to 0 hit points. Furthermore, you don't suffer the effects of the end of any "haste" spell from the axe.

𝙍𝙚𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙙. While holding the axe, if you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points but doesn’t kill you outright, you can use your reaction (before falling unconscious) to interrupt the current turn. You then immediately take an extra turn, and regain any hit points you lost since the end of your last turn, up to a maximum of 24 hit points. You are affected by the "haste" spell for the duration of this extra turn. Once this property of the axe has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
