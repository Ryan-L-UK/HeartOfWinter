Stylist's Circlet
Wondrous item, common
___

While wearing this leather circlet, you can use a bonus action to change your hair's length, color, and styling. When you remove the circlet, your hair returns to its natural appearance. Your hair can grow up to 5 feet long in this way, and any hair you cut off immediately vanishes.
