⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Sword of the Pack Leader Weapon (any sword), uncommon
___

This magic sword carries the unspoken leadership of a mighty wolf. When you hit a creature with the weapon, you can choose to mark it for your allies to strike. The creature remains marked until the start of your next turn or until you attack a different creature or are no longer holding the sword. For the duration, the first attack roll against the marked creature on each of your allies' turns is made with advantage. If the marked creature is slain, the sword releases a magical howl, and each hostile creature within 15 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Once the sword has been used to mark a creature, it can't do so again until the next dawn.
