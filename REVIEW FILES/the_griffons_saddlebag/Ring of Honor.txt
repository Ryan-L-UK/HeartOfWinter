💍 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Ring of Honor Ring, rare
___

This golden ring is shaped like a crown. It can hold up to 5 charges and gains 1 charge each time you slay a Small or larger hostile creature while wearing it. The ring loses all charges if you're reduced to 0 hit points or remove it.

When the ring gains its 5th charge, you can use a bonus action once within the next 24 hours to expend all 5 charges. When you do, a spectral, golden crown appears on your head for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain the following benefits:

• You gain a +1 bonus to AC.
• You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
• You gain 5 temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns.
• You're immune to the frightened condition.

The effect ends early if you're reduced to 0 hit points. If you don't use this property within 24 hours of the ring gaining its 5th charge, the ring loses all charges.
