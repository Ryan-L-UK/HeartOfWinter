Helm of the Deep Sea Knight Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This patinaed knight's helm has subtle frog-like elements worked into its otherwise functional design. Its narrow visor rests at eye level and is covered by a curved pane of thick glass. The helm weighs 6 pounds and takes 1 minute to don or doff. While wearing this helmet, you can breathe underwater, and you can walk normally on the bottom of any lake, sea, or other body of water. In addition, your weapon attacks suffer none of the penalties of underwater combat.
