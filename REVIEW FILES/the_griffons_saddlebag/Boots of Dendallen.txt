💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Boots of Dendallen
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

These dark, fleshy boots grant marvelous powers and enhance your normal movement. While wearing these boots, you gain a hover speed equal to your walking speed. You can hover up to 20 feet off the ground using these boots, leaving behind a thin trail of shadow while you do. When you take the Dash action, you can move an additional 10 feet if you're walking or hovering.

In addition, the boots have 4 charges and regain 1d3+1 expended charges each day at dusk. You can expend 1 charge to cast the "expeditious retreat" or "misty step" spell using the boots. When you cast misty step in this way, the normally silver mist that surrounds you is dark and ominous.

𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚. When you pull these boots over your feet for the first time, make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you are aware of the curse's effects and can immediately remove the boots before it takes hold. On a failure, the boots' muscly sinews dig into your own flesh and interlock with your own. You immediately take 4d8 necrotic damage as the tainted muscles and flesh latch onto you, and you can't remove the boots unless you're targeted by the "remove curse" spell or similar magic. While you wear the boots, your feet sometimes move in unexpected ways. You make Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage, and it costs you an extra 10 feet of movement to stand up after you fall prone.

If you fail the saving throw to resist the curse and later remove the boots, you take another 4d8 necrotic damage as they painfully release themselves from your body.
