💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Scepter of Faith
Rod, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric)
___

This rod is imbued with the last remaining magic from a pious saint. While holding the rod, you can use a bonus action to cast the "shield of faith" spell from it on a creature other than you within range. When an attacker within 60 feet of you deals damage to a creature under the effect of this spell, you can use your reaction to cause a spectral shield to appear before it and push the attacker 5 feet away from the creature.

In addition, while holding the rod, you can use an action to cast either the "guardian of faith" or "find the path" spell. When cast in this way, "find the path" can only be used to find the route to a temple or other holy site. Once the rod has cast either of these spells in this way, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
