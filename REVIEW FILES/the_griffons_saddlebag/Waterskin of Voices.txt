Waterskin of Voices
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This leather waterskin has a magical beverage inside that allows you to briefly alter your voice. When found, the waterskin has 1d6 + 4 servings. You can drink 1 of the servings while holding the waterskin using an action. When you do, choose a voice from a creature you've heard or one from your imagination. The next 25 words you speak within 10 minutes sound virtually indistinguishable from the voice you chose, though a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that the voice is magically altered. If the voice you chose belongs to another creature, that creature automatically knows that the voice is altered.
