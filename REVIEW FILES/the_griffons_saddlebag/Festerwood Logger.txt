Festerwood Logger
Weapon (handaxe), uncommon
___

This axe is a favorite among lumberjacks. The axe is made entirely of the magically hardened festerwood and sharpened to a menacing edge. The weapon's glimmering yellow pustules saturate it's blade with acid, causing any target hit by the weapon to take an extra 1d4 acid damage with each strike. This acid damage is maximized if the target is a plant creature, nonmagical plant, or an object made of wood.
