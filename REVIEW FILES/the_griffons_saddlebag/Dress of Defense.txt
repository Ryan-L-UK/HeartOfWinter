Dress of Defense
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This dress has several decorative armor plates adorning it, but is otherwise made of layers of lush and sheer fabric. While wearing this dress, you gain a +1 bonus to AC if you are wearing no armor. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. As a bonus action, you can speak the dress' command word to cause its armored plates to emit a protective magical force, causing the bonus to increase to +3 for 1 minute. Once this property of the dress has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
