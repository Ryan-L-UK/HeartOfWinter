Moonfallen Maul Weapon (maul), rare
___

This maul's stone head is carved from fallen moon rock. A howling wolf and pockmarked moon are carved into the weapon. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, or a +2 bonus if it's between dusk and dawn. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target of the attack must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. The target has disadvantage on the saving throw if it can see the moon or if it's cursed with lycanthropy. A frightened creature immediately falls prone as it recoils.
