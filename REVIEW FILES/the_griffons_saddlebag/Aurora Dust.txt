Aurora Dust
Wondrous item, common
___

This bag is filled with 1d6 + 4 pinches of iridescent blue dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over an open flame. The dust changes the flame's color and light to a mixture of blue, green, and purple, and creates a shimmering aurora the same color above it within the bright light. The dust's effect lasts for the flame's duration (up to 24 hours).
