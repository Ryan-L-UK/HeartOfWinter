💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Belt of Orion Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

While wearing this belt, you have advantage on any ability check made to track a beast or monstrosity. In addition, when you hit a beast or monstrosity with a weapon attack, you deal an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type.

𝙎𝙪𝙢𝙢𝙤𝙣 𝙃𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙𝙨. You can use an action while wearing this belt to summon two mastiffs, which appear in unoccupied spaces of your choice within 10 feet of you. The mastiffs are friendly to you and your companions, and take their turns immediately after you. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. Each mastiff remains for 1 hour or until it's reduced to 0 hit points. While at least one mastiff remains, you gain a +5 bonus on any ability check made to track a creature. Once this property of the belt has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
