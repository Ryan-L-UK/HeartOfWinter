Quick Change Ring
Ring, rare
___

This ring grows and shrinks to fit its wearer, but always seems slightly large for the finger it's on. The ring has an extradimensional space inside it dedicated to carrying armor. You can magically bind one set of unworn light, medium, or heavy armor to this extradimensional space over the course of 1 hour by resting the ring on top of the armor. Only one suit of armor can be bound to the ring's extradimensional space. Binding a second suit breaks the bond with the first one, causing it to be forced from the extradimensional space and appear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the ring. While wearing the ring, you're considered to be within 100 feet of any armor stored inside its extradimensional space.

While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command word and touch a suit of bound armor, even if you're wearing it, to shunt it into the ring's extradimensional space. Speaking the command word again while the armor is in this extradimensional space causes you to magically don the armor, adjusting to fit you as needed, or for it to appear at your feet (your choice). If you're already wearing a suit of armor when you don one in this way, the bound armor appears at your feet instead. If the armor would magically prevent you from doffing it, this property has no effect.

You can create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect when you don or or doff a suit of armor with the ring in this way, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.

When found, the ring has a 50 percent chance to have a set of bound armor in its extradimensional space. The GM can choose a suit of bound armor from the following table or roll a d12 to determine it randomly.
