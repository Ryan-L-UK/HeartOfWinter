Rime of the Justicar Weapon (glaive), rare (requires attunement)
___

The icy blade of this glaive has been formed atop a ruined spear haft. A tattered emblem hangs at its side.

The weapon has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you take cold or fire damage while holding this magic weapon, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges and gain resistance to that damage type until the end of your next turn, including against the triggering damage. For the duration, the first target you hit with the glaive takes an extra 1d8 cold damage from the attack.

𝙃𝙖𝙩𝙚𝙛𝙪𝙡 𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙧𝙢. While holding the glaive, you can use a bonus action to cast the "sleet storm" spell (save DC 15) with the following changes:

- The spell remains centered on you and swirls around you in a sphere. It affects all other creatures within 10 feet of you, instead of its normal area.
- You are immune to the spell's effects.
- A creature only makes the saving throw against the storm's effects on its turn, even if the storm enters its space on your turn.
- For the duration, the first time you hit a creature on each of your turns with the glaive, that creature takes an extra 1d8 cold damage.

The spell ends early if you are no longer holding the glaive. When you take damage while concentrating on the spell, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the weapon's charges and roll a d8, adding the number rolled to the Constitution saving throw you make to maintain concentration on the spell.

This property of the weapon can't be used again until the next dawn.
