Gnashing Key
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This curious brass key is animated by a weak enchantment. When placed in the keyhole of a lock, it magically begins to open and shut its mouth-like key bit, loudly destroying the inside of the lock over the course of 1 minute. At the end of the minute, the lock is destroyed and forced open. If the lock’s DC is greater than 15, the key has a percent chance to break before the end of the minute. The percent chance is equal to 5 times the difference between the lock’s DC and 15. If the key breaks, the lock is instead jammed shut and the key is destroyed, but can still be seen protruding from the keyhole.

While the key is destroying a lock, the sound of breaking tumblers and grating metal can be heard out to a range of 90 feet.
