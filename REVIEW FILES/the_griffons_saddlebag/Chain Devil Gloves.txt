Chain Devil Gloves
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

These leather gloves are fashioned from the hands of a slain chain devil. While wearing these gloves, an ethereal chain attaches itself to any weapon you throw that has the thrown property. The chain has a reach of 60 feet and breaks its connection to the weapon if the weapon is held by a creature or if you are ever more than 60 feet away from it. You can have up to 4 of these chains at any time.

As an action, you can cause these chains to suddenly retract and pull any attached weapons with them. Any creature within the path of one or more of these weapons must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes force damage equal to the damage die of the thrown weapon. A solid object or wall blocks the path of the retracted chain and weapon.

A retracted weapon lands harmlessly at your feet or in an open hand once it reaches you.
