💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Keycoin
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This brass coin is 1 inch in diameter and has a keyhole-shaped hole at its center. You can use an action to insert the coin into a keyhole within your reach, causing the door to magically unlock. The coin disappears once it enters the keyhole, even if the door was already unlocked. The coin magically shrinks to fit a smaller keyhole.

If the door or lock is held shut with "arcane lock", that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the door or lock can be opened and shut normally.

A "keycoin's" magic isn't lost after it's been used. Instead, it magically reappears in a random location 1d100 miles away from you.
