Scroll of the Jester
Scroll, rare
___

Using an action to read this scroll, your appearance magically changes to become a jester. At the same time, 8 perfect illusions of jesters that are identical to you appear in random unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of you. When the jesters appear, each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you as if you had cast the “enthrall” spell (no concentration required).

Each jester is indistinguishable from you and shares your AC, initiative, speed, and bonuses to saving throws. On your turn, you can mentally command each jester where to move (no action required). You can choose to see through a jester's eyes, hear what it hears, or speak through it in your own voice. A creature with truesight can determine which jester is you.

The jesters remain as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 minute. A jester disappears early in a plume of confetti if it takes any damage, if it's more than 120 feet away from you, or if you choose to expend it in order to create one of the following effects:

• As an action, you can expend 1 or more jesters to cast one of the following spells (save DC 15, no concentration required): charm person (1 jester), "color spray" (1 jester), "confusion "(4 jesters), "greater invisibility" (4 jesters), "hideous laughter" (1 jester), "hypnotic pattern" (3 jesters), "levitate" (2 jesters), or "major image" (3 jesters). When you cast a spell in this way, you can cause the spell to originate from you or from a jester that you can see.

• As a bonus action or as a reaction when you take damage, you can expend 1 jester to immediately and imperceptibly teleport, swapping places with it. The jester disappears after it arrives in your original space.

When the last jester disappears, any effects or spells created by the scroll or its jesters end.
