Magic Pocket Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This pocket can be tied onto a belt or similarly worn as extra storage. On its own, the pocket can hold up to 6 cubic inches of total volume. However, if the pocket is left in an extradimensional space such as a "bag of holding" or "handy haversack" for at least one hour, it forms a magical connection to that space. You can reach into a "magic pocket" with such a connection using an action to access the extradimensional space, provided that the source of that space is within 60 feet of you.

The hole to the pocket is 4 inches wide, preventing larger objects from being withdrawn from or deposited into the extradimensional space. Destroying the "magic pocket" has no impact on the extradimensional space it's connected to, or vice versa, nor can anything living within the space exit through the pocket without first being accessed by it.

Placing the pocket in an extradimensional space while it's already connected to another one immediately severs the connection. After an hour in the new space, the pocket forms a new connection to the space as normal.
