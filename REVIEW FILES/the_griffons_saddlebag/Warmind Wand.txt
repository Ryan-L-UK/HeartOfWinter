💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Warmind Wand
Wand, rare (requires attunement by a half-orc or orc)
___

This wand is made from the shattered hilt and jawbone of a defeated warband leader. It has 7 charges for the following properties and regains 1d6 + 1 expended each day at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand releases a small gasp of breath as its magic escapes it, leaving the wand a nonmagical and mundane sword hilt.
.
You can use the wand to command and bolster your allies using the following properties:
.
• 𝙒𝙖𝙧𝙗𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙎𝙩𝙧𝙞𝙠𝙚. When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks and expend 1 charge as a bonus action to direct one of your allies to attack. When you do, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack.
.
• 𝙁𝙤𝙧𝙢 𝙍𝙖𝙣𝙠𝙨. You can expend 1 charge as an action to bolster the resolve and command one of your allies to move to a more advantageous position. When you do, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains 2d4+2 temporary hit points and can use its reaction to move up to half its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks. Temporary hit points gained in this way fade after 1 minute.
.
• 𝙁𝙤𝙧𝙘𝙚𝙙 𝙀𝙣𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙚. When a friendly creature other than you within 30 feet that can see and hear you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction and expend 2 charges to prevent that creature from falling unconscious and remain at 1 hit point instead. Once this property has been used on a creature, that creature can't benefit from it again until it completes a long rest.
.
• 𝙐𝙣𝙮𝙞𝙚𝙡𝙙𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘾𝙧𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙘𝙖𝙡. When a friendly creature other than you within 30 feet that can see and hear you scores a critical hit, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to amplify the brutality of the attack and add an extra 2d4 damage to the total of the attack's damage roll.
