💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Bird of a Feather 
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This small stuffed roc toy is filled with an enchanted down. While holding onto the toy and concentrating, you magically gain a flying speed of 20 feet for up to one minute.

If you take any damage while flying, you lose concentration on the magical toy early and immediately start falling. Once a creature has used this ability, the toy cannot grant it again for 1d4 hours. It gives a happy little chirp when its magic can be used again.

The stuffed toy's weak magic cannot carry anything weighing more than 200 pounds.
