Axe Beak Tomahawk
Weapon (handaxe), uncommon
___

This magic handaxe is made from the remains of a slain axe beak. The first time on your turn that you hit a creature that has a flying speed with an attack using this axe, that creature is forced to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. Each time that a creature fails this saving throw, that creature's flying speed is reduced by 15 feet for 1 minute.
