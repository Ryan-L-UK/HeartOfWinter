💍 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Ring of the Sandskimmer
Ring, uncommon
___

This ring is made entirely of sand that ebbs and flows around your finger. The sand is magically held together by a single, perfectly smooth tiger's eye stone that spins in place as the sand brushes past it. While you wear this ring, you leave no footprints behind when you walk in sand and treat all nonmagical difficult terrain in sand as if it were normal terrain.
