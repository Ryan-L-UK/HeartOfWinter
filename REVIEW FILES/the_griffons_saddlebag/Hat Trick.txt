💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Hat Trick
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This gaudy purple hat allows the wearer to perform some minor magical feats. The hat has 3 charges and regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. While holding the hat, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the "find familiar" spell from it, pulling the familiar from the hat. The summoned familiar can take the form of either a rabbit or dove, using the statistics for a weasel or owl, respectively. The familiar remains for up to 1 minute instead of its normal duration and cannot be used to deliver spells.

In addition, while wearing the hat, you can use an action to cast the "prestidigitation" spell from it. When cast in this way, the spell can only be used to create harmless, illusory effects.
