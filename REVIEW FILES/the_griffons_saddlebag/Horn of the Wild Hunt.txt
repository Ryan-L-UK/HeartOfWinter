💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Horn of the Wild Hunt
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

This large, spiraling warhorn has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 charge and blow the horn, summoning a war elk as if you had cast the "find steed" spell. A war elk uses the same statistics as a giant elk with the following changes: its size is Large, it has AC 14 (hide barding), and has 37 hit points. The steed disappears if your attunement to the horn ends.

Alternatively, you can use an action to expend 1 of the horn's charges to speak its command word and then blow the horn. When you do, a spectral stampede of elk trample the area in a line 60 feet long and 15 feet wide that extends from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

When you blow the horn, it emits a deep, rumbling tone that is audible 300 feet away.
