Knocking Boots
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

These steel-toed boots of dwarven make are adorned with an embossed key on the toe. As an action, you can kick an object that contains a mundane or magical means of preventing access to cast "knock" on it. Once you use this ability, the boots cannot be used again in this way until the following dawn.
