𝙍𝙚𝙩𝙧𝙞𝙗𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙫𝙚 𝘾𝙤𝙡𝙙. When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you while wearing this armor, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 cold damage to that creature.

𝙁𝙧𝙚𝙚𝙯𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙁𝙤𝙜. While wearing this armor, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to cast the "gaseous form" spell from it, targeting yourself only, with the following changes:
.
• You take the form of a frigid cloud of fog, creating illusory frost on objects you touch.
.
• You can take the Attack action while in this form. When you do, your attacks are unarmed strikes that deal 1d6 cold damage, instead of their normal damage.
.
• You can use the armor's Retributive Cold property.
.
• The spell has a duration of 1 minute.

Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.
