💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Seafarer's Jacket
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This long captain's jacket carries with it an air of authority. Water slides off of it with ease, and magically enhances your comfort in the ocean. You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed while wearing the jacket, as well as proficiency with water vehicles and navigator's tools. If you already have proficiency with water vehicles and navigator's tools, your proficiency bonus is doubled when using them. In addition, the jacket allows you to cast "fog cloud" at second level. Once you cast this spell, you cannot do so again until the following dawn.
