Starmetal Solar Axe
Weapon (greataxe), legendary (requires attunement)
___

This heavy metal magical weapon is forged using iron from the stars. While you're attuned to this weapon, you can call upon its latent stellar energy to catalyze change within the metal and create endothermic and exothermic reactions.

A creature takes 3d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much lightning damage on a successful one. This property can't be used again for 12 hours.

𝙁𝙪𝙨𝙞𝙤𝙣. While holding both battleaxes, you can use a bonus action to speak the weapon's other command word to recombine the two battleaxes into its "fused state". When you do... 🔽 Continued below!
