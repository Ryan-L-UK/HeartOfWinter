⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Tormentor's Flail Weapon (flail), rare
___

The head of this flail is in the shape of a metal skull that's pierced with large construction spikes. When you hit a creature that's missing any of its hit points with this magic weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage.

In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
