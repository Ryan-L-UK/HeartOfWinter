Immovable Cat Wondrous item, rare
___

This life-sized marble statue of a cat weighs only 1 pound when carried. You can use an action to speak one of its two command words while holding it, causing the statue to spring to life.
The first command word causes the cat to immediately lie down and seemingly go to sleep. A creature within reach of the cat can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the cat up to 5 feet on a success.

The second command word causes the cat to run toward and pounce on a target that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must then succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and restrained by the cat. The cat then lies down on the target and seemingly goes to sleep. A creature within reach of the cat can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the cat to the nearest unoccupied space on a success.

The cat returns to its normal weight, sits up, and ceases to be animated when you speak its command word again using an action, even if you aren't holding it. Only the creature that first spoke the cat's command word to animate it can end the effect by speaking the command word again; even if another creature speaks the word, the cat does not respond to it.

While animated, the cat has AC 15, 20 hit points, and resistance to all damage. If the "mending" spell is cast on the cat while it has at least 1 hit point, it regains 2d6 hit points. If the cat drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its normal weight and can’t be used again for 24 hours, at which point it regains all its hit points.
