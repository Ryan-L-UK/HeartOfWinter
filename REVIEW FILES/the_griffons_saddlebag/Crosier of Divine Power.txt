Crosier of Divine Power
Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)
___

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
This staff is enchanted with powerful holy magic that manifests as radiant motes of power during times of need. At the start of each of your turns in combat, roll a d6. On a 6, a mote of power appears above the head of the staff. When you hit a target with the staff or heal a creature with a spell or magical effect while holding it, you can expend 1 mote to add 2d6 to the total hit points healed or damage dealt. Extra damage done in this way is radiant damage.

Each mote lasts for 1 minute or until it's expended. When you roll for initiative against a hostile creature, the staff creates 2 motes.
