Dragon Edge Weapons
Weapon (any slashing or piercing simple weapon), uncommon, rare (+1), or very rare (+2)
___

This weapon is made from the harvested remains of a fallen dragon. With a properly reclaimed claw or tooth, as determined by the DM, the resource can be forged into a weapon whose latent draconic powers can appear in battle.

The first time you hit a creature on your turn with this weapon with an attack that you had advantage on, the weapon's draconic magic comes forth to deal an extra 1d6 damage of the original dragon's damage type. Refer to the Monster Manual to determine the dragon's color and associated damage type.

Weapons made from the claws or teeth of dragons change in rarity and power depending on the original dragon's age. Young dragons' bones aren't as powerful as older ones, and create uncommon weapons. Adult dragons can produce rare weapons with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with them, and Ancient dragons can create very rare weapons with a +2 bonus instead.
