Ironleaf Plate
Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)
___

This set of plate armor is lined and overgrown with magical vines and gives you a +1 bonus to your AC. While wearing the armor, its vines seem to move the armor's metal plates when you move, allowing you to ignore the plate armor's normally imposed disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In addition, the vines are able to absorb some of the impact from blunt attacks, granting you resistance to bludgeoning damage.

When you take fire damage, the leaves wither and lose some of their protection until the start of your next turn. While the leaves are withered in this way, you are not resistant to bludgeoning damage.

𝙈𝙖𝙣𝙩𝙡𝙚 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙒𝙞𝙡𝙙. While wearing this armor, you can cast "pass without trace" once without expending a spell slot. Once you've cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until the following dawn.
