Steel Hawk Handaxe
Weapon (handaxe), uncommon
___

When you hurl this magic axe and speak its command word, choose up to 4 different creatures that you can see, recording the order in which you choose each one. The first target must be within the weapon's range; each subsequent one must be within 20 feet of the previous target. Make a ranged attack against each target using the handaxe, treating each one after the first as if the weapon was thrown from the previous target's space. Immediately after the last attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.

This property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the handaxe can still be used as a magic weapon.
