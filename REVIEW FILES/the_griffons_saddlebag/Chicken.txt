Chicken Tonic Potion, common
___

A willing creature that drinks this tonic is magically transformed into a ceramic chicken for up to 10 minutes, as if by the "polymorph" spell, or until it ends the effect as a bonus action. The creature retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its skill and saving throw proficiencies (including those of the chicken). Use the raven's statistics for the chicken, with the exception that its flying speed is halved and it falls at the end of its turn if it's in the air and nothing else is holding it aloft. The tonic's container is a porcelain chicken, and the potion itself is a seemingly wretched mixture of eggs and gravy. The potion has no effect on an unwilling creature.
