Displacement Leathers Armor (leather), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This armor creates a blurry afterimage of you while you move. When a creature hits you with an opportunity attack while wearing this armor, roll a d20 (no action required). On an 11 or higher, the attack misses and hits a nearby illusion of you instead. On a 10 or lower, the attack hits you. Once this property of the armor has been used for the fourth time, it can't be used again until you finish a long rest.
