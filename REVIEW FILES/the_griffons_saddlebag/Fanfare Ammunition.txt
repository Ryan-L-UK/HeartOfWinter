Fanfare Ammunition
Weapon (an arrow or bolt), common
___

A favorite among tricksters, this ammunition is made to distract as opposed to wound. When you make a ranged attack with this ammunition and hit a target, the attack does no damage, and the ammunition evaporates and is destroyed upon impact. In its place, a noise of your choice erupts from the point of impact, such as the sound of books falling, a dropped coin, or breaking glass. You decide the noise and its volume when you fire the ammunition. The sound can be as quiet as a whisper or as loud as a scream. A creature can determine that the sound is an illusion with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check.
