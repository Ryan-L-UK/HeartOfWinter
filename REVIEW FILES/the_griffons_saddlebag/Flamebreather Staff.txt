⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Flamebreather Staff
Weapon (quarterstaff), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This red, hollow quarterstaff releases a plume of fire when spun. When you hit with an attack using this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 1d4 fire damage.

In addition, while holding the quarterstaff, you can speak its command word as an action to cause it to release a gout of flame from its end, duplicating the effect of the "burning hands" spell (save DC 13). This property of the quarterstaff can't be used again until the next dawn.
