Inferno Rope
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This 10-foot long rope smells of sulfur and crackles with embers when moved. As an action, you can lay the rope down in a line on solid ground and set it ablaze using its command word. When you do, the rope becomes a 15-foot tall wall of vertical fire along its length. The flames are visible, but not opaque, and are 1 inch thick. Creatures within 5 feet of the flames when first ignited must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 fire damage. A creature setting the rope ablaze automatically succeed on the saving throw. The flames last for 1 minute and cast bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for another 15 feet. A creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw when it crosses the line of fire for the first time on its turn or ends its turn there or take 2d4 fire damage.

The rope rematerializes at the base of the flames after 1 minute. Once the rope has been lit, it can't be used again in this way until the next dawn. The rope can only be cut by magical means and becomes a nonmagical length of rope when cut in this way.
