Alcoholock⁠
Wondrous item, common⁠
___⁠
⁠
This lock looks like a small metal tankard, using its handle as the shackle. While it has a keyhole, it doesn't open with a key and can't be picked using thieves' tools. Instead, the lock only opens when at least 1 ounce of a particular kind of alcohol is poured into the keyhole.⁠
⁠
You can bind an alcoholock to an alcohol by submerging it in the drink for 1 hour. The drink can be made of one or several kinds of alcohol, potentially complicating the lock. Once bound, the lock can't be bound to a different kind of drink. You can identify what drink the lock is bound to with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, using your sense of smell to detect what's been poured into the lock. The DC increases by 2 for each additional kind of alcohol used to bind the lock after the first, up to a maximum DC of 25. An identify spell also determines what drink the lock is bound to. Alternatively, the lock can be broken with a successful DC 25 Strength check.⁠
⁠
The poured drink needn't match the exact age, ingredients, or maker of the bound one. For example, if the lock is bound to mead, any mead of the same or similar flavor that's poured into the lock will open it. If the bound drink is a mixture of two or more ingredients, a close approximation of the mixture will open the lock (at the GM's discretion).
