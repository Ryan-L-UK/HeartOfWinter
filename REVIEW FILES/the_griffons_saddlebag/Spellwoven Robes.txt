Spellwoven Robes
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

These robes are unique to the wearer and are spun from special, magic-sensitive threads. While wearing these robes, you gain an additional way to calculate your AC. Your AC equals 10 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Whenever you cast a spell of first level or higher, you can also change the apparent style, color, and apparent material of the robe. Regardless of its appearance, it is always a robe and its weight remains the same. Glowing, arcane glyphs appear on the robe's fabric when you cast a spell before fading away a moment later.
