Wand of the Dragon Queen Wand, rare (requires attunement)
___

Five chromatic dragon heads coil up toward the tip of this wand, which has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to release a gout of dragon's breath from the wand. For 1 charge, the area of dragon's breath is a 15-foot cone. You can increase the size of the cone by 5 feet for each additional charge you expend. Each creature in the breath's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d10 acid damage, 1d10 cold damage, 1d10 fire damage, 1d10 lightning damage, and 1d10 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand is consumed by its own elements and is destroyed.
