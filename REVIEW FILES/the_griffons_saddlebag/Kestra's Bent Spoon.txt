Kestra's Bent Spoon
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This silver spoon once belonged to a mystic with an unending appetite. It has three runes etched into the metal that perform various magical functions.
.
• "Ulm", in the bowl of the spoon, enhances the flavor of any soup or similarly spoonable dish by drawing out the more nuanced flavors that are often overlooked.
.
• "Tox", on the back of the spoon's head, causes the spoon to tarnish and dim when touched by a poison. The spoon remains this way until the next dawn, when its normal luster magically reappears.
.
• "Seera", on the handle, strengthens the power of certain psychic effects. While the spoon is on your person and you roll psychic damage, you can focus your attention on the spoon (no action required) to deal maximum damage on one of the damage dice. Once this rune has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
