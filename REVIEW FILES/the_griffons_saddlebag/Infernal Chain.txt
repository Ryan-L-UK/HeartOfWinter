Infernal Chain
Weapon (flail), very rare (requires attunement)
___

This length of heavy chain has a weight at its end and is always warm to the touch. The chain is 10 feet long and weighs 10 pounds. When you attune to the chain, it magically coils up one of your arms (your choice) and secures itself in place. When you swing it, the chain magically extends from you before returning to coil around your arm once again. You must use a hand in order to swing and use the chain.

When swung, the chain releases flames and billowing smoke. This magic weapon has the reach and heavy properties, and any target hit with it takes an extra 1d8 fire damage.

You can choose to use this chain instead of your normal reach when you grapple a target on your turn. While a target is grappled by the chain, you can't use the chain to make a weapon attack, but you can use a bonus action to pull the target 5 feet toward you. At the start of each of its turns, a creature grappled by the chain takes 2d8 fire damage. A creature grappled by the chain doesn't have its speed reduced as a result of the grapple, but it can't move farther than 10 feet away from you until the grapple ends.

𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚. This chain is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unable to remove the chain from your arm, and at the start of each of your turns while a celestial is within 30 feet of you (that you are aware of), you must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to use your action to attack the nearest celestial. In addition, while cursed, you gain the following flaw: "I delight in exploiting my enemy's flaws and fears to make them suffer."
