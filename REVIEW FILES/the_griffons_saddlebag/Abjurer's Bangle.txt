💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Abjurer's Bangle
Wondrous item, rarity varies
___

You can clasp or remove this metal bracelet around the wrist or ankle of yourself or a willing creature within your reach using an action. The bangle emits a ward of abjuration magic from it that has a number of hit points determined by its rarity. A creature wearing the bangle can use its reaction when it takes damage to speak the bangle's command word, causing the magical ward to take the damage instead. Any excess damage carries over to the creature when the bangle's ward is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point the bangle becomes a nonmagical bracelet.

| Rarity | Ward Hit Points |

| Uncommon | 30 |
| Rare | 75 |
| Very Rare | 120 |
