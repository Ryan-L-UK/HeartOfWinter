Orner's Venomous Crossbow
Weapon (crossbow, hand), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This magic crossbow carries a small system of curious tubes and vessels. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The crossbow has 4 charges and regains 1d3 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend 1 of the weapon's charges when you make an attack with it to coat the fired bolt with a unique, self-generating venom. If the attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d6 poison damage and must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is poisoned until the end of its next turn.

If you expend the crossbow's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the vessels attached to the crossbow shatter and spray poison in a 25-foot-radius sphere centered on your location. Creatures within the sphere take 1d12 poison damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. When this happens, the crossbow ceases to be magical and loses all of its additional properties.
