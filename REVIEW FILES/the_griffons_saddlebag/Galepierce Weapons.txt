⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Galepierce Weapons
Weapon (any piercing weapon with the thrown property), uncommon
___

These magic weapons have been tempered to glide through the wind, doubling both their normal and long throwing ranges. Ranged attacks made with these weapons against targets that are protected by fog, high winds, and other air-based hindrances are made without the normal disadvantage that those obstructions would typically cause.
