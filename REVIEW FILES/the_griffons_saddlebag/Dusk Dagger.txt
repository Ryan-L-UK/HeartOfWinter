Dusk Dagger
Weapon (dagger), rarity varies
___

This delicately curved dagger is ornamented with several crescent moon designs. When you hit a creature who is completely in dim light or darkness with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 1d4 (uncommon), 1d8 (rare), or 1d12 (very rare) psychic damage.
