Bulette Bulwark
Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This leather-wrapped shield was made from the armored body of a bulette and still retains some of its natural properties. While holding this shield, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

In addition, the shield has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the shield, you can use a bonus action to speak the shield's command word and expend 1 of its charges. When you do, you gain tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet. This effect lasts as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 minute, or until you drop or stow the shield.
