⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Wyvernblade Weapon (rapier or shortsword), rare (requires attunement)
___

This blade's guard is fashioned after a wyvern in its design. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The weapon has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the weapon, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to fly up to 60 feet in a straight line toward a point or target that you can see. If the target is a creature, you can also make a special attack against it using the blade. On a hit, the target takes an extra 4d6 poison damage, and it can't use its reaction until the start of its next turn. You have advantage on the attack if you fly at least 30 feet toward the target in this way. At the end of your turn, you can choose to fly up to another 30 feet either horizontally or downward.
