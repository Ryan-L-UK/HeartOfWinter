💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Winter Ward Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

This warm ushanka bears the symbol of a clan of winter wolves, made as a gift to a hunter who aided them against an invasion of giants. While wearing the hat, you gain resistance to cold damage. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell and on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy terrain. You can speak and understand Winter Wolf, and you have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with winter wolves.

𝙎𝙪𝙢𝙢𝙤𝙣 𝙒𝙞𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙒𝙤𝙡𝙛. This hat is bound to a celestial spirit loyal to the winter wolf clan. While wearing the hat, you can cast the "find steed" spell with the following changes:

• The spirit assumes the form of a winter wolf and its creature type is always celestial.
• The spirit acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it takes its turn immediately after yours. When summoned in this way, the spirit's Cold Breath recharges after it finishes a short or long rest.
• When you dismiss the spirit as an action, it can't be summoned again until the next dawn.
• If the spirit drops to 0 hit points, it bursts into a flurry of snow and can't be summoned again until 7 days have passed.
