Mourningsteel Half Plate
Armor (half plate), legendary (requires attunement)
___

This dark armor has been made from mourningsteel, a metal refined from ore found beneath the battlefields of particularly vicious wars. Steeped in the blood from relentless battles, this metal carries with it a magical aversion to all things holy. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and have resistance to radiant damage. While you wear it, you gain the following benefits:

𝘿𝙚𝙖𝙩𝙝 𝙏𝙧𝙖𝙣𝙨𝙛𝙚𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚. Whenever you are subjected to necrotic damage, you can use your reaction to take no damage and instead gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt. This property of the armor can't be used again until the next dusk.

𝙎𝙥𝙚𝙡𝙡𝙨. You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17) from the armor: "bestow curse", "divine word", or "nondetection". Once the armor has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dusk.

𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝘽𝙖𝙩𝙩𝙡𝙚𝙛𝙞𝙚𝙡𝙙 𝙍𝙚𝙢𝙚𝙢𝙗𝙚𝙧𝙨. You can use an action to touch a weapon, piece of armor, or similar object that's seen blood and battle to recreate the effect of the "legend lore" spell, using the touched object as the subject of the effect. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

𝙐𝙣𝙝𝙤𝙡𝙮 𝘼𝙪𝙧𝙖. As a bonus action, you can speak the armor's command word to surround yourself with an aura of grim blasphemy. The aura remains for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or die. For the duration, celestials have disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and the first time that a celestial moves within 5 feet of you on its turn or starts its turn there, that creature takes 1d10 necrotic damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. In addition, once before the aura ends, if you fail a saving throw against an effect from a celestial (such as a solar's Slaying Longbow), you can choose to succeed instead. Once the aura ends, it can't be used again until the next dusk.
