Bag of Bellstones
Wondrous item, common
___

This cloth bag shines like brass and can hold up to 20 small stones. When found, the bag has 1d12 + 8 stones inside. A stone that's been in the bag for at least 1 minute becomes magical until the end of your turn when you remove it, if it isn't already. While a stone is magical in this way, it emits a clear, bell-like ringing that's audible out to a range of 60 feet whenever it hits a target or touches an object or surface.
