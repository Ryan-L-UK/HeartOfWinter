Staff of Awakening Staff, artifact (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
___

This fey staff's shaft is hewn from the wood of an ancient, mysterious oak in the Ebony Glade, whose roots are said to have absorbed the dreams of elves from long ago. A perfect sphere of amber from that same oak hangs suspended in the center of it. While attuned to the staff, you are immune to the "dream" and "sleep" spells.

𝘾𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙜𝙚𝙨. The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the staff's last charge and are not fey or lack the Fey Ancestry trait, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff disappears into a dreamlike mist and returns to the Ebony Glade in the realm of the fey.

You can use the staff to cast the normal version of the spell at 1st level by expending 2 or more of its charges in this way, instead. For every 2 charges you spend after the 2nd, the level of the spell increases by 1.

When you fail to put a creature to sleep with a "sleep" spell cast from the staff, that creature takes an amount of psychic damage equal to half the spell's remaining hit point total.

[Prerequisite: 5th level] 𝙍𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙙. While attuned to the staff, the amount of time you need to finish a long rest is halved, down to a minimum of 4 hours.

[Prerequisite: 9th level] 𝘿𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙢 𝙒𝙖𝙡𝙠𝙚𝙧. "Sleep" spells you cast roll an extra die when determining the spell's total number of hit points. In addition, you can reroll any 1 or 2...
