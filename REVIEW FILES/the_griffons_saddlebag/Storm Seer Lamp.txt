💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Storm Seer Lamp
Wondrous item, common
___

This crystal lantern gives off a faint, refreshing smell that reminds you of being near the ocean. As a bonus action, you can touch the crystal to cause it to glow, casting bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. You can alter the radius when you touch the crystal in this way. Once the lamp has glowed for a total of 8 hours, it can't be used again in this way until the next dusk. You can cause the light to fade using a bonus action to touch the crystal again.

In addition, the lamp can detect incoming storms up to 3 hours before they arrive. If an approaching storm would affect the area within 1 mile of the lamp, the crystal's light becomes an eerie, cold gray.
