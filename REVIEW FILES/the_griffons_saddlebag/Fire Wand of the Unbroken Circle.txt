Fire Wand of the Unbroken Circle
Wand, rare (requires attunement by a druid)
___

This wooden wand is carved out of ash and is always faintly warm to the touch. Whenever you grip the wand's handle and later look at your palm, it's strangely covered in a fine layer of charcoal. This wand has 7 charges. While holding the wand, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast either the "flame blade" spell (2 charges) or "produce flame" cantrip (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level) using the wand with a spell attack bonus of +5. When you cast the "flame blade" spell using this wand, the sword's fiery blade appears above the wand's haft instead of in a free hand.

Whenever you would fail a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a "flame blade" spell cast from the wand, you can expend 1 charge as a reaction in order to succeed on the saving throw instead. You can only use your reaction in this way if you’re holding the wand.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand bursts into flame and is destroyed before crumbling into ashes.
