These black leather and human bone chain gloves spread sickness and decay to the things they touch. While wearing the gloves, your unarmed strikes deal necrotic damage and you can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strikes. This damage is maximized if you hit a plant or plant creature with the attack.

In addition, you can use the gloves to cast the following spells using a save DC of 16 and attack bonus of +8: "blight", "contagion", or "vampiric touch". Casting blight in this way uses a range of touch instead of its normal range. Once the gloves have been used to cast a spell, they can't be used to cast that spell again until the following dusk.

𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚. When you pull these gloves over your hands for the first time, make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you are aware of the curse's effects and can immediately remove the gloves before it takes hold. On a failure, the gloves' bone chains pierce your skin and latch onto the bone in your arms. You take 4d6 piercing damage and can't remove the gloves unless you're targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. While you wear the gloves, the flesh on your hands slowly rots. The stench can't be contained or masked through magical or nonmagical means. While your hands rot in this way, you make Charisma checks with disadvantage and take 1d6 necrotic damage whenever you complete a long rest.

If you fail the saving throw when first donning the gloves and later remove them, it takes 1d4 days for the effects of the rotting flesh to fade.
