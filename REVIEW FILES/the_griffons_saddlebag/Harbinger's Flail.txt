Harbinger's Flail
Weapon (flail), rare
___

This whip-like chain flail's head is a sonorous bell from the Temple of Twin Fates, a holy site known for its grim foretellings. This weapon has the reach property and deals an extra 1d4 thunder damage to any target it hits. When it hits a target, the bell releases a deep sound that's audible out to 100 feet.
