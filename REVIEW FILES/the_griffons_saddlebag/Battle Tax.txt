Weapon (battleaxe), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This golden battleaxe is the chosen weapon of many merchants and followers of mercantile gods. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against a Small or larger creature that is hostile towards you, you magically earn a number of gold coins equal to the damage from the attack. The golden axe glimmers when you hit with an attack in this way, and you can feel the reassuring weight and clink of coins materialize and fall into your purse, pocket, or bag (whichever you prefer). If you have no room for the coins or don't want them to be immediately added to your storage, the coins erupt from the wound you inflict on the target instead. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again for 12 hours.
