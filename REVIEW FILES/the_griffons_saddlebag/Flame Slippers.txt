Flame Slippers Wondrous item, uncommon
___

These red shoes have flames adorning them along the heels and by the ankles. While wearing the shoes, you can use a bonus action to click their heels together and activate their magic. While active, the shoes produce harmless flames from the soles of your feet whenever you take a step, which shed bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. In addition, if you take damage as a result of falling while the shoes are active, flames blast outward from where you land. Each other creature within 5 feet of you when you land must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take fire damage equal to half the amount of bludgeoning damage you took as a result of falling (up to a maximum of 20 fire damage). If you fall prone while the shoes are active as a result of falling, standing up before the end of your next turn only costs you 5 feet of movement, rather than an amount equal to half your speed. The shoes remain active until you use another bonus action to click their heels together again, or until you're no longer wearing them.
