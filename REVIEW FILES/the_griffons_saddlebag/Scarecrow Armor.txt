Scarecrow Armor Armor (padded), very rare (requires attunement)
___

Stray bits of old straw poke out from the seams and edges of this armor. While wearing it, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. This armor doesn't impose disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks while you're attuned to it.

While wearing the armor, you can spend one Hit Die when the "mending" spell is cast on it to regain hit points. When you do, use the maximum number possible on the Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total. In addition, when you regain hit points from spent Hit Dice while wearing the armor, you can magically reattach a limb you've lost by holding it to the place that it was severed from.

𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚. This armor is cursed, and attuning to it extends that curse to you. You remain cursed until targeted by the "greater restoration" spell or similar magic. Removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you are vulnerable to fire damage and your insides are turned to straw. Your physical appearance remains unchanged and you no longer need food or water, but you have a 50 percent chance to lose a limb (at the GM's option) as part of suffering a critical hit or as the result of dropping to 0 hit points.
