Bug Smashers
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This grotesque pair of gloves are made using the barbed exoskeleton and harvested remains of a giant centipede. When you roll a 20 on an unarmed attack roll using these knuckles, the target takes an extra 2d6 poison damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of your next turn. Unarmed attacks with these gloves deal either bludgeoning or piercing damage (your choice).
