💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Wand of Meadow's Rest Wand, rare
___

This wand looks and smells like a flourishing sprig of lavender. It has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into petals and is destroyed.

𝙎𝙡𝙚𝙚𝙥. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the "sleep" spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend, up to 5th level. Creatures that have a trait that grants them advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell are considered to have half as many current hit points for the purposes of determining the number of creatures affected by the spell.

𝙉𝙖𝙩𝙪𝙧𝙚'𝙨 𝙍𝙚𝙨𝙥𝙞𝙩𝙚. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 7 of its charges and wave it in the air above you. You and up to five willing creatures you choose within 20 feet of you are lulled into a restful sleep. A sleeping creature remains unconscious for 10 minutes. It wakes up early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. If a creature remains asleep for the full duration, it wakes up and gains the benefit of a short rest. This property of the wand fails if you aren't outside.
