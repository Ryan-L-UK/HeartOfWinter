Gi of Shifting Seasons
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a monk)
___

When found, this gi is gray with a large tree design at its bottom hem. When you attune to the gi, its color and tree design changes to resemble the current season: Winter (blue, leafless), Spring (green, pink blossoms), Summer (red, green leaves), or Autumn (Yellow, red leaves along the bottom hem). While the gi resembles a season, it gains the following respective benefits:

𝙒𝙞𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙧. You are immune to the effects of extreme cold, and whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, that creature's speed is reduced by 5 feet (to a minimum speed of 15 feet) until the start of your next turn.

𝙎𝙥𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜. When the gi changes to this season, you gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points. In addition, when you use your Step of the Wind, your jump distance is tripled, instead of doubled, and you ignore the effects of difficult terrain until the end of your turn.

𝙎𝙪𝙢𝙢𝙚𝙧. You are immune to the effects of extreme heat, and whenever you hit a target with an unarmed strike, the target takes an additional 2 fire damage. If you are outside during the day, the target takes an additional 3 fire damage, instead.

𝘼𝙪𝙩𝙪𝙢𝙣. You have advantage on Constitution saving throws. When you use your Patient Defense, creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move within 5 feet of you until the start of your next turn.

You can change the gi's season to another one of your choice by spending 1 minute in silent meditation. Alternatively, whenever you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to spend 1 or more ki points, you can choose to shift the gi's season by one, moving in chronological order. When you do, you choose whether to gain the season's benefits before or after the action. For example, if the gi is in Autumn and you spend 1 ki point to use Flurry of Blows, the gi can immediately change to represent Winter and grant the season's benefits to your Flurry of Blows.
