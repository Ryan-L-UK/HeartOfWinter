Wand of the Frostrose
Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
___

This icy wand has a magical blue rose frozen at its center. The flower is a frostrose: a rare and delicate rose found only in the coldest parts of the Everglacier.

The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend up to 3 of its charges to create 1 or more Medium ice sculptures on the ground within 60 feet of you, creating 1 sculpture for each charge you expend. Each sculpture must appear in an unoccupied space on the ground you can see within range. Each sculpture is a delicate, thorned rose made of ice and is always a Medium object with 1 hit point and AC 12. A sculpture melts after 1 minute, or 8 hours if it's in the Everglacier. If a sculpture falls to 0 hit points, it erupts in a burst of icy shrapnel and is destroyed, causing all creatures within 20 feet of it to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. An ice sculpture caught in this explosion erupts automatically, intensifying the blast. A creature takes 3d8 piercing damage and 3d6 cold damage on a failed save, plus an extra 1d8 piercing damage for each explosion it's affected by beyond the first. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much piercing damage and cold damage.

The sculptures softly groan and crackle from the pressure they contain within them. A creature can determine the explosive nature of the sculptures with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Investigation) check. Spaces occupied by the icy sculptures are difficult terrain.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand melts into a puddle of water, and the frostrose at its center crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
