💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Naga's Caduceus of Rebirth Rod, rare
___

This scepter has a skull at its top with a diamond fitted into each of its two eye sockets. When found, the rod has 1d2 diamonds remaining. While holding the scepter, you can use an action to cast the "revivify" spell from it, without consuming any costly components. When you do, one of the diamonds in the scepter's skull shatters. Once the second diamond shatters, it can't be used to cast the spell again. The scepter can also be used as a magic mace, which has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙉𝙖𝙜𝙖 𝙒𝙞𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣. The following properties are only discovered 24 hours after the second diamond has been shattered, or by a "legend lore" spell. An "identify" spell fails to reveal them.

A spirit naga is held captive within this rod. 24 hours after the second diamond shatters, the rod turns black and ashen as the naga is released, appearing in the nearest unoccupied space within 30 feet of the rod. The naga is hostile, and is determined to end the lives of any creature that was revived using the rod's magic. The naga always knows the general direction to the nearest creature revived in this way.

The only way to prevent the naga from returning to life after 1d6 days (short of a "wish" spell), is to slay it with the rod. When you do, both the rod and naga are destroyed.
