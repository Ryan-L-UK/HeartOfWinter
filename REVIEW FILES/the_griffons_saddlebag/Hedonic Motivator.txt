Weapon (whip), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This magic whip once belonged to an especially controlling succubus or incubus. The whip has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dusk. While holding the whip, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to lash out with it against a friendly creature within 10 feet of you. That creature gains one of the following benefits of your choice:

• The creature gains 2d4 + 4 temporary hit points, which last for 1 minute.
• The creature can add 1d4 + 2 to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.
