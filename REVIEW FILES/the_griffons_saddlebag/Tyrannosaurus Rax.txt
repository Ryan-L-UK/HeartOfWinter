Tyrannosaurus Rax
Weapon (greataxe), rare (requires attunement)
___

This bone-carved axe can channel the might of a rampaging tyrannosaurus rex. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding the axe, you can use a bonus action to rampage. While rampaging, you can move through the space of any creature of your size or smaller. When you move through a creature's space in this way while rampaging, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn. Once on each of your turns while rampaging, you can force a creature whose space you move through in this way to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice). On a failed save, that creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. In addition, while you're rampaging, your weapon attacks with this weapon score a critical hit against objects, structures, and prone creatures on a roll of 19 or 20.

Your rampage lasts for up to 1 minute. It ends early if you don't move through a hostile creature's space on your turn or if you drop to 0 hit points. This property of the axe can be used twice and regains all expended uses daily at dawn.
