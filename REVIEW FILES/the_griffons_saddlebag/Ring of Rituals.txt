💍 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Ring of Rituals
Ring, uncommon
___

While wearing this ring, you can speak its command word to cause a small, illusory flame to appear above it. The flame gives off light like a normal candle but doesn't require oxygen or give off heat. Speaking the command word again snuffs out the light.

In addition, when you cast the ritual version of a spell, you can use the ring as a material component of the spell in addition to its normal requirements. When you do, the ritual version of the spell's total casting time is reduced by 5 minutes. Once this property of the ring has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
