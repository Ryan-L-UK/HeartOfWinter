💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Muralist's Mark Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

This painter's apron is covered with smears of paint, which never entirely dry. While wearing the apron, you can use it and the paints on it as if it were a painter's palette, mixing and manipulating the colors on it indefinitely. The apron magically produces paints in whatever colors you need.

While wearing the apron, you gain a +5 bonus to any ability check made using a set of painter's supplies. Using the apron's paints and your hands, the "muralist's mark" can be used on its own as a set of painter's supplies.

𝙄𝙢𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙨𝙞𝙤𝙣. While touching a flat surface and wearing the apron, you can use an action to meld yourself and all the equipment you carry with the surface. The surface must be large enough to fully contain your body. For the duration, you remain visible on the melded surface, but only as a painted rendering of your appearance.

This rendering moves with you along the surface. You are indistinguishable from a normal painting while you remain motionless in this form. You retain your normal movement while melded with the surface, obeying gravity as if you were in your normal form. If the surface you're melded with is rotated or turned upside down, you move in such a way according to gravity's pull. While in this form, you can only interact with objects that are flush against the surface (such as a table, frame, or painted line), treating each one as if it were a ledge, wall, or similar surface. For example, you could use a series of hanging picture frames to climb up a tall gallery wall, or slide back down along a painted line.

You can use a bonus action to change your rendering's artistic style and size, down to a minimum height of 1 foot or up to your normal height, proportionally. You can only move along the flat surface if it can fit your painted form. By doing so, you can follow a surface around corners or climb onto ceilings or floors, provided that the two surfaces are contiguous.

While merged with the surface, you can see and hear what occurs outside it using your normal senses....
