💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Pendant of the Tempered Fury
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

This magical silvered pendant glows with a barely contained flame of rage trapped inside of its clenched fist. Small sparks occasionally shoot out from between the pendant's metal fingers. The simmering anger from the pendant tightens your focus and allows you to shrug off some of the damage you take. If you are wearing no armor and using no shield while you wear this pendant, all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing, you take is reduced by 3.

In addition, the pendant holds 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dawn. You can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to cause your hands to erupt into flame. When lit, your arms and hands cast bright light in a 10 foot radius and dim light for another 10 feet, and your unarmed attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage to any target they hit. Your hands remain lit for 1 minute or until you use a bonus action to quench them again.

Any flame created by the pendant, whether it be on your hands or on the pendant itself, is harmless to you. While your hands are ignited, your unarmed strikes are also considered magical.
