Pocket Poppet Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This little stuffed doll is featureless and has a small pocket sewn onto its belly. The pocket is large enough for a single coin, ring, or similarly-sized object. You can link the poppet to a creature by attaching one or more defining objects to it using pins, wax, and so on. For each defining object, such as a clump of hair, an illustration of the creature's face, or shred of worn clothing, the connection to the creature becomes stronger.

While holding the poppet, you can use an action to place an object inside its pocket and speak the command word. If the creature linked to the poppet is on the same plane of existence as you, it must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, which is modified by the sort of physical connections the poppet has to it. Even if multiple connections of the same type are attached to the poppet, each save modifier can only be applied once. If a target knows you're using this property, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily.

On a failed save, the object magically vanishes from the poppet's pocket and reappears in the bag or pocket (your choice) of the creature linked to the poppet. If the creature has neither a bag or pocket on it, the object clatters to the ground at their feet instead. On a successful save, or if the creature isn't on the same plane of existence as you, the object remains in the poppet's pocket. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
