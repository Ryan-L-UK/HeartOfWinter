💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Set of Numat’s Trick Tubes 
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This drab pair of empty ceramic cylinders are magically linked. Each vessel is 3 inches in diameter and one foot tall. Opening one of the vessel's lids and placing an item inside will magically teleport it to the second tube, making a quiet whoosh sound when it does. A very quiet thud can be heard when receiving an item.  A tube cannot hold more than 2 pounds of materials at any time, and both lids must be closed for the items to be teleported. Items can only be sent if the two tubes are on the same plane of existence. A creature cannot be sent through the tubes.
