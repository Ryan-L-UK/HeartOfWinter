💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Abjurer's Gilder
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a wizard)
___

This golden badge is usually given to wizards who either excel at or have mastered abjuration magic as a symbol of their accomplishments. While wearing this badge, preparing the "shield" spell doesn't count against the total number of spells you can have prepared at one time. In addition, whenever you cast the "shield" spell, you can take another reaction before the start of your next turn. This second reaction can't be used to cast the "shield" spell again.
