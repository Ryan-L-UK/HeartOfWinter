Potion of Nature's Growth Potion, uncommon
___

The muddy slurry at the bottom of this green potion bottle is filled with plant-growing magic. The bottle itself is in the shape of an upside-down tree, with its canopy creating the rounded base of the vessel. You can use an action to either drink the potion or upend it, pouring it onto soil.

If you drink the potion, you gain the benefits of the "barkskin" spell for 1 hour (no concentration required). In addition, sunlight gives you nutrients for the next 1d4 + 3 days: for the duration, you don't need to eat, provided that you spend at least 1 hour in sunlight each day. If you pour the potion on the ground and plant the bottle there, all plants in a 300-foot radius centered on the potion become enriched for 30 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.
