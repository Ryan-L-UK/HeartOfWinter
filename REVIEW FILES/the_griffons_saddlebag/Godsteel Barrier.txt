Godsteel Barrier Armor (shield), legendary (requires attunement)
___

This golden tower shield emits an almost impenetrable aura of protection from it. While holding this shield, you have a +3 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. In addition, if you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you can choose to use your Strength modifier for it, instead of Dexterity. If you succeed on the saving throw using your Strength modifier in this way, you take no damage from the effect, as you interpose your shield between yourself and the source of the effect.

While holding the shield, you can use a bonus action to gain 25 temporary hit points and extend the shield's aura to protect your nearby allies. Choose up to four other creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you. The extended aura lasts for 10 minutes or until your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell); it ends early if the effect is targeted by a "dispel magic" spell of 5th level or higher, or if you're no longer holding the shield. For the duration, each of those creatures gains a +3 bonus to AC. A creature loses this bonus if it's ever more than 60 feet away from you. In addition, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to change which creatures within the aura's range gain this bonus to AC. If you have any temporary hit points granted by this or another item with "godsteel" in the name, your concentration on this effect can't be broken as a result of taking damage. Once this property of the shield has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
