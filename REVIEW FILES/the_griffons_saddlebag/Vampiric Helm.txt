💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Vampiric Helm Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

While wearing this helmet, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing and have blindsight out to 10 feet, provided that you're not deafened.

𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚. Once you don this cursed helmet, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. While wearing the helmet, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against vampires (or vampire spawn) and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.

In addition, your teeth grow pointed, and you hunger for blood. If you enter a space within 5 feet of a grappled or restrained creature on your turn or start your turn there, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. You can choose to fail this saving throw. On a failure, you're compelled to use your action to make an unarmed strike against that creature, biting it on a hit. The bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike, plus 2d6 necrotic damage. You then gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
