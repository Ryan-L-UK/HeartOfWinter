Polaris Magistrate Codex
Wondrous item, rare or legendary (requires attunement by a lawful creature)
___

This gilded book of law is filled with detailed ordinances regarding Polaris, a city held aloft by astral magic. Through the city's dedicated magistrate, this book has been given the following magical properties.

The book can be used as an improvised light hammer, which you are proficient with while attuned to it. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage, or half as much psychic damage if it's lawful.

While holding the book, you can use an action to read from it aloud and wrack nearby creatures with guilt for their wrongdoing. When you do, each creature within 15 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage. On a success, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. If a creature is lawful, it has a +5 bonus to the saving throw.

Original copies of a "Polaris Magistrate codex" are almost unheard of, but the ones that exist have spent centuries steeped in their own powerful scripture—intensifying their magic. The following codex variant is a legendary item with additional properties:

𝘼𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙙𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙨. The book deals an extra 2d6 psychic damage on a hit, instead of 1d6, and returns to your hand immediately after making a ranged attack with it. In addition, the saving throw DC for when you read from the book increases to 17, and deals 4d6 psychic damage instead of 2d6.

𝘽𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙇𝙖𝙬. You can use an action while holding the book to cast the "hold person" spell (save DC 17). On a success, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. If a creature is lawful, it has a +5 bonus to the saving throw.

𝙊𝙗𝙟𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. While holding the book, you can use your reaction to cast "counterspell" (5th-level version) from it. If the triggering spell was cast at 6th level or higher, the "counterspell" automatically fails. Once the book has been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dawn.
