Diorama Die
Wondrous item, common
___

This six-sided die is an inch across and unfolds to reveal miniature scenes inside it. You can speak its command word using an action and choose to either roll the die or place it with a number of your choice facing up. If you roll the die, record whether you cast, drop, shake, or spin it when doing so. If the die is rolled in multiple ways, record each one.

When the die lands on a number, it opens up to expose a miniature, illusory diorama inside of it. The die either unfolds partially or completely when doing so (your choice). Use the table below to determine the nature of the die's scene, combining any relevant effects to determine the result. You can collect the "diorama die" (no action required), causing it to close when you do. A new scene is created each time you speak the die's command word and either roll or place the die.
