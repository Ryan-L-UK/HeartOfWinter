Couatl Herald's Guard
Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)
___

This magic shield is made from yew and covered in durable couatl feathers. When a creature you can see within 10 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically take that damage, instead of the creature taking it. When you do so, the damage type changes to force. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until you complete a short or long rest.

𝙁𝙡𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝘾𝙤𝙪𝙖𝙩𝙡𝙨. While you're attuned to 3 items with this feature, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. If you already have a flying speed, this speed is in addition to your existing flying speed.
