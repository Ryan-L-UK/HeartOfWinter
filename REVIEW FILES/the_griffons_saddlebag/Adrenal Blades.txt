⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Adrenal Blades Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)
___

This pair of scimitars are made of darkened steel and have feather-like designs. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic weapons, which are considered to be a single item for the purposes of attuning to them. While holding one of the swords, you always know the general direction and distance of the other. While the swords are on your person, choose one of the following benefits whenever you roll initiative. These benefits last for 1 minute.

𝗙𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁. The weapons' bonus increases to +3, instead of +1. You have advantage on opportunity attacks made with them.

𝗙𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁. You gain a flying speed of 40 feet, but fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft. Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

In addition, if a creature forces you to make a saving throw against becoming frightened, you can immediately use your reaction (before making the saving throw) to move up to your speed in a straight line toward that creature. If the target is within 5 feet of you at the end of this movement, you can also make two weapon attacks against it: one with each scimitar. For each attack that hits, you gain a +5 bonus to the saving throw against becoming frightened.
