⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Drill Lance Weapon (lance), rare (requires attunement)
___

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. On a hit, the lance's point whirs as it rapidly spins. When you attack a creature or object made of stone or wood with this magic lance and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.

𝙊𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙘𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙜𝙚. The lance magically stores your movement into its own, spinning faster as you charge forward. Once per turn, if you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then attack it with the lance on the same turn, the weapon releases a superheated line of energy from it in the direction of the target. The line is 15 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 fire damage. If the triggering attack also hits, this fire damage is in addition to the weapon's damage against the target.
