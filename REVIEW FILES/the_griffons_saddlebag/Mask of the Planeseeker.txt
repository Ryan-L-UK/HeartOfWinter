Mask of the Planeseeker Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
___

This elaborate mask was first worn by an interplanar diplomat. While wearing it, you understand any spoken language you hear, and when you speak, any creature that can hear you and knows at least one language can understand what you say. The mask also functions as an "amulet of the planes." You can't be unwillingly transported to another plane of existence or teleported against your will while wearing this mask.

Depending on the plane of existence it's on, the mask's appearance and effect changes. Its appearance is stylized and ornate, regardless of the form it takes. Refer to the table below to determine its effects on various planes.

Plane of Existence | Mask Appearance | Gemstone Color and Damage Type |

Material Plane       |   An ornate rendition of your own face    |        Pearlescent; Force

A gemstone sits at the center of the mask's forehead, which draws power from the associated plane of existence. You gain resistance to the damage type associated with the gemstone.

The mask has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the mask, you can expend 1 of its charges as a bonus action to change the plane of existence the mask is associated with. After 1 hour, the mask reverts to its normal form.
