⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Hunter Shark Cutlass Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)
___

The blade of this sword is carved from the tooth of a giant shark. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If the target is a creature that's missing any of its hit points, it takes an extra 1d6 slashing damage from the attack. You have advantage on any Wisdom (Survival) check made to track a creature you've hit with the sword within the last hour.

In addition, while the sword is on your person, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and can breathe underwater. Further, sharks are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.
