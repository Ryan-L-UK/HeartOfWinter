Oaken Candle
Wondrous item, common
___

This magic, bark-like candle emits a green flame when burned, which sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. You can light the candle as an action. After burning for 1d8 + 4 hours, the candle is destroyed and an oak tree no more than 30 feet tall grows in its place over the course of 10 minutes. If there isn't enough room for a tree to grow or the candle isn't placed on solid ground, the candle is destroyed without creating a tree.
