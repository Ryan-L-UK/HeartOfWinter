⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Ice Sickle
Weapon (sickle), uncommon
___

This magic sickle from the Everglacier is perpetually covered in tiny, needle-like icicles along its edge that reform almost as soon as they're gone. The first target hit by this weapon on each of your turns takes an extra 1d6 cold damage from the attack.
