Boots of the Cloud Jumper
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

While wearing these boots, you can choose to jump once while in the air as if you'd leapt from solid ground. You can't jump farther than your remaining movement would allow, and you treat all jumps made in this way as they were standing jumps. When leaping mid-air in this way, thin, cloudy wisps fly out from under your feet and immediately disappear. The boots allow you to jump in this way once before they need to make contact with a solid surface again. Jumping in this way while falling prevents up to 20 feet of fall damage.
