💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Tear of Gaia
Wondrous item, common
___

As an action, you can crush this small, green gem underfoot to activate its magic. Plants within a 10 foot radius  of you immediately become healthy and full. If there are no plants within range or you crush the gem against an inorganic material, fertile topsoil an inch deep spreads across the area. Grass immediately begins to grow from the new soil. Fruit and vegetable-bearing plants begin to grow their produce, and are able to be eaten after an hour's time to grow.
