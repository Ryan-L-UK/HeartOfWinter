Mace of the Fish Tyrant Weapon (mace), very rare (requires attunement)
___

Inside the water-filled glass head of this mace is colorful fish. Despite the movement of the water sloshing about inside the weapon, the fish remains perfectly still inside it. The fish is immortal while it remains within the mace and can't be affected by magic.

When found, the mace is a very rare magic item with the following properties:

• You have resistance to psychic damage.
• You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
• Targets hit with the mace take an extra 1d4 psychic damage.
• If you make an attack with the mace while not attuned to it, you take 1d4 psychic damage as the fish magically exerts its frustration upon you.

𝙎𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚. While the weapon itself is not sentient, the fish within it is lawful evil with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

The fish can speak, read, and understand Deep Speech, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to the mace, the fish also understands every language you know.

𝙋𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙤𝙣𝙖𝙡𝙞𝙩𝙮. While the fish doesn't need to eat, it hungers to be near the minds of intelligent creatures. The more creatures that are near it, the happier it becomes. It speaks with grim certainty of all things and expects to be obeyed. While you are attuned to the mace, the fish knows your greatest desires.

𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚. This mace is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the mace, keeping it within reach at all times.

You remain cursed until targeted by the "remove curse" spell or until a "banishment" spell of 5th level or higher is cast on the mace. When banished in this way, the mace remains, but the fish is returned to its home plane. You can feel a great sense of relief from the fish as it leaves the mace. When this happens, the weapon becomes a regular "+1 mace". However, you are granted a permanent boon by the fish as it departs: you gain resistance to psychic damage.
