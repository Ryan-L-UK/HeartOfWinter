Dryad's Key
Wondrous item, rare
___

This lush, green leaf has a bug-bitten, key-like tooth at the bottom of its stem. While holding the leaf, you can use an action to speak its command word and place it into or against a Large or larger tree, turning it like a key and casting the "transport via plants" spell from it, using the tree as the entrance for the spell. Once the leaf has been used in this way, it withers and becomes a nonmagical leaf.
