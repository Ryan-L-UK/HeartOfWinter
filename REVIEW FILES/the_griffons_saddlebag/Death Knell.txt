⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Death Knell
Weapon (halberd), rare (requires attunement)
___

This heavy metal weapon is dark and grimly ornate. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Once per turn when you reduce a Small or larger creature to 0 hit points with an attack using this weapon, a foreboding, gong-like sound emanates from the blade. When this happens, any hostile creature that's missing any of its hit points within 15 feet of the slain creature is forced to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d8 psychic damage, or half as much on a success.
