Tea Weird
Wondrous item, common
___

This Tiny, sentient fragment of a charmed water elemental has an endless desire to create tea. When given a leaf or other potential tea ingredient, its watery form gurgles happily as it begins to steep it, magically heating the water surrounding the ingredient to its ideal brewing temperature. It only picks up materials it chooses to and can control whether or not it's wet to the touch. The "tea weird" can inhabit up to 1 gallon of water, or as little as 1 ounce. Any water controlled by the "tea weird" is magical for the duration.

The "tea weird" is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has a speed of 5 feet and can hover up to 5 feet off the ground. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and has resistance to all damage. The "tea weird" regains all its hit points if given at least 1 ounce of water. Drinking the entire tea weird is harmless to you, but destroys the item.

𝙎𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚. The "tea weird" is a sentient chaotic good item with an Intelligence of 3, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 6. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It can't speak or read, but understands Aquan and Common.

𝙋𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙤𝙣𝙖𝙡𝙞𝙩𝙮. The "tea weird" is dedicated to making tea. It will happily collect moisture, steep it with fresh ingredients, and then separate itself from the freshly brewed tea by pouring it into a cup or similar vessel. It avoids combat at all costs and enjoys resting in cups, kettles, or the pockets of friendly creatures.
