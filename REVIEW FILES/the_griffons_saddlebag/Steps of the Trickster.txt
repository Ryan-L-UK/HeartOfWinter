💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Steps of the Trickster
Wondrous item, common
___

Wearing these shoes allow you to freely change the sound of your steps. Changing the sound can't change its volume, but can make them sound as if the shoes are made from a different material. For example, your steps can sound like they’re an approaching guard’s metal boots, or a dancer’s sharp heels.
