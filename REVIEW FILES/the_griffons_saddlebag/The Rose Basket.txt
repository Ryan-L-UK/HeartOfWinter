The Rose Basket
Weapon (rapier), very rare (requires attunement)
___

This silver rapier has a rose adorning its crossguard and pommel and thorns lining its hilt. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, a shapechanger or fey creature hit by the weapon takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

𝙁𝙞𝙚𝙡𝙙 𝙤𝙛 𝙍𝙤𝙨𝙚𝙨. As an action, you can speak the rapier's command word and touch its point to the ground at your feet. When you do, silver rosebushes sprout from the ground in a 25-foot square centered on your location. The area becomes difficult terrain, and when a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. While holding this rapier, you can traverse this area as if it were normal terrain, and you don't take damage from moving within it. The rosebushes remain for 1 minute or until you dismiss them as a bonus action. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.
