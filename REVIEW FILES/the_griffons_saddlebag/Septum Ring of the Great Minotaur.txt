💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Septum Ring of the Great Minotaur
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

This septum barbell, forged of tempered gold and studded with rubies, magically bestows the might of a minotaur when worn through the nose. Across the gap of the ring is a polished fragment of horn from an ancient and powerful minotaur. The ring changes in size to fit the creature who attunes to it. While wearing the ring, your Strength score increase by 2, to a maximum of 22, and you have advantage on Strength checks. In addition, your carrying capacity doubles, and you can perfectly recall any path you've traveled within the past 24 hours.
