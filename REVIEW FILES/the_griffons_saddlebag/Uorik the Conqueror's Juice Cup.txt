Uorik the Conqueror's Juice Cup
Wondrous item, common
___

This friendly copper cup changes the flavor of water that's poured into it. As a bonus action, you can whisper the name of a fruit into the mouth of the cup. If the cup is filled with water, its color and flavor change to resemble the kind of juice the fruit makes when juiced. Uttering the name of another fruit into the cup changes its flavor and color again. Regardless of its appearance and flavor, the water is still only water. Shouting into the cup instead causes the juice to effervesce and bubble. If the water is poisoned, the drink tastes foul and badly fermented.
