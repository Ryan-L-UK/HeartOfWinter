⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Mirrorlight Piercer
Weapon (spear), very rare (requires attunement)
___

This crystalline spear bends the light it generates in such a way that it becomes corporeal. While you hold the spear in one hand and have another hand free, you can speak the spear's command word as an action to cause it to create a ghostly projection of itself in your free hand. Both the spear and its projection have the light property. When you use an action to create a projection in this way, you can make a single weapon attack as part of that action. The projection lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it using a bonus action or another creature attempts to hold it. If you drop or stow the crystalline spear, the projection disappears until you hold the spear again.

If you throw the projection as a ranged attack, the projection disappears after it hits or misses its target. If you're still holding the crystalline spear when this happens, it magically recreates the projection in your open hand again (no action required). You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon and any of its projections. The spear can only have 1 projection active at a time. While it has a projection, the spear and projection each cast bright light out to 5 feet and dim light for another 5 feet. If you don't have an open hand when the spear attempts to create a projection, the projection is dismissed.
