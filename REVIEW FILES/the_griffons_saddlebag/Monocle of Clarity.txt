This single lens has three filters that you can peer through. You can change the monocle's filter by rotating the lens' outer ring. A small arrow along the edge of the frame indicates the monocle's selected filter. The monocle has 4 charges and regains 1d3+1 each day at dawn. As an action, you can expend a charge to look through and activate one of the filters to gain one of several benefits:
