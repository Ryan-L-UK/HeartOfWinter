Powergem Pommel
Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)
___

A "powergem pommel" is a magical attachment for a weapon's handle. While you're attuned to it, you can fasten the pommel onto a melee weapon over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest or while attuning to the item. A pommel can have 1 (uncommon), 2 (rare), or 3 (very rare) slots around it designed for holding precious gemstones. You can use an action to place or remove a gemstone worth at least 1,000 gp in a slot, which magically resizes to fit the stone. When you hit a target with a melee weapon with the pommel attached, it deals an extra 2 damage for each gemstone you place in it. The damage types for this extra damage depend on the placed gemstones' dominant colors (at the GM's discretion), as shown in the table below.

| Color (Example) | Damage Type |
—
| Black (Black sapphire, large black pearl) | Necrotic |
| Blue (Blue sapphire, blue spinel) | Lightning |
| Colorless (Diamond) | Radiant |
| Green (Emerald, peridot) | Poison |
| Purple (Large amethyst) | Psychic |
| Red (Fire opal, ruby) | Fire |
| White (Large pearl, opal) | Cold |
| Yellow  (Large amber, topaz) | Acid |
