💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Grave Trodders Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

While wearing these boots, you have resistance to necrotic damage. In addition, the boots have 5 charges and regain 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use an action while touching a corpse with your foot or standing no more than 10 feet above its grave to cast the "speak with dead" spell on it. If more than one corpse is directly below you, the closest one is affected by the spell.

This version of the "speak with dead" spell has the following changes:

- Instead of asking a corpse five questions, you instead expend 1 charge whenever you ask it a question. When the boots are reduced to 0 charges and the corpse has finished answering the last question it was asked, the spell ends. The spell ends early if you use the boots to ask a different corpse a question.
- This version of the spell doesn't fail if the target has been affected by this spell within the last 10 days.
- If you can't hear the corpse (such as if you're standing above its grave), you still know how the corpse responded to your question.
- If the boots have 0 charges, they can't be used to cast the spell. If you cast the spell from the boots and don't ask the affected corpse any questions, it still expends 1 charge from the boots.
