Weapon( crossbow, light), rare (requires attunement)
___

This hollow metal crossbow was created by a team of kobolds and contains an enchanted ember at its core. While holding this magic crossbow, the ember burns brightly inside, causing flames to lick out from various gaps left along the weapon's frame. The crossbow has 3 charges and continues to burn while it has at least 1 remaining charge. While it burns, the crossbow emits bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, and any nonmagical bolt fired from the crossbow catches fire and deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits.

You can expend 1 charge from the crossbow as an action to cause the flame to spew forth and send out a devastating wave of fire. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

The crossbow regains 1d3 expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the magic ember inside the crossbow dies, and the weapon becomes a nonmagical crossbow.
