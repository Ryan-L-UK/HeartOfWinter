Whirling Weapons
Weapon (any melee weapon without the special or two-handed property), rare
___

These magic weapons were forged with lightweight metals and designed for speed rather than brute force. "Whirling weapons" have the finesse and light properties and whistle softly when swung through the air. When you take the Attack action and attack with a "whirling weapon" that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make another attack with the same weapon. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you're holding a different "whirling weapon" in each hand and engage in two-weapon fighting, you can make one attack with each weapon when you use a bonus action in this way.

In addition, if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting fighting style, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attacks.
