💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Departed Helm Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

You have resistance to necrotic damage while wearing this helmet. Skeletons and creatures with a challenge rating of 5 or lower with "skeleton" or "skeletal" in the name are also indifferent toward you while you wear it. Such a creature won't attack you unless you threaten or harm them, or unless they're commanded to do so by a creature controlling them. In addition, you can also use an action to determine how long ago a corpse or creature you're touching died or was turned into an undead.

When determining the time of death or turning to undeath of a corpse or creature, the accuracy depends on the recency of the event. If the event happened within the last 24 hours, you know the exact minute when it occurred. Otherwise, you know only the hour (within 7 days), day (within 30 days), week (within 6 months), month (within 1 year), year (within 10 years), decade (within 100 years), or century for any time longer.
