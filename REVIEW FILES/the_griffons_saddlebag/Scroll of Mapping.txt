Scroll of Mapping
Scroll, uncommon or very rare
___

By using an action to read the scroll, you cause the arcane script on the page to vanish and become an inked map of the surrounding area. The map shows the area in a 1-mile radius centered on the point where you read the scroll and indicates both structures and topography. By touching the map, a small light appears at your location to indicate where you are. Using a series of natural gestures when touching the page, you can cause the map to change its scale or displayed portion of the area. The scroll isn't destroyed when you read it, but can't be used again to create a different map.

The following "scroll of mapping" is a very rare variant with additional properties.

This map is in color and displays the names of large and small locations, depending on the map's scale, such as the name of the region, street, or nearby shop. In addition, you can use an action to touch the map and ask it where a familiar person or place is that you can name or clearly describe. If the person or place is somewhere that can be shown on the map, an X appears on it at the target's location. If there are multiple targets with the same name or description within the area, multiple marks appear. If the target is a creature that's in a different form, such as being under the effects of a "polymorph" spell, or can't be detected by divination magic or scrying sensors, the map doesn't display its location. If the target is moving, the X follows its movements for the duration. The marked target remains shown on the map for 10 minutes, after which time the X vanishes. Once this property of the map has been used, it can't be used again until 12 hours have passed.
