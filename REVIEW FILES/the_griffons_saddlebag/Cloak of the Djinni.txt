💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Cloak of the Djinni
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This floating, cloud-soft cloak flutters softly on its own even without wind. It has 3 charges and regains 1 charge whenever you finish your turn without using any movement or expending any of the cloak's charges. While wearing the cloak, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to spin around and emit a powerful twister. Each creature within a 5-foot radius of you must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet away from you and take 1d8 bludgeoning damage.

For each additional charge you expend after the first, you can choose to increase either the radius of the twister by 5 feet or the bludgeoning damage it deals by 1d8.
