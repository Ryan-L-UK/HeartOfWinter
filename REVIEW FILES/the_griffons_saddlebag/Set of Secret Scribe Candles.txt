Set of Secret Scribe Candles
Wondrous item, rare
___

This set of candles are magically linked and never seems to run out of wick.

You can light one of the candles to cause it to burn with a blue flame. By holding parchment over the flame, any ink on the page is burnt off, leaving the paper unmarked. When you finish using the candle in this way, you can extinguish the flame as you normally would. Once you do, the linked candle suddenly comes alight with a normal, orange fire, that cannot be extinguished by nonmagical means. The lit candle gives off a faint lavender scent. By holding a plain piece of parchment over the orange flame, the ink and message from the first sheet is magically burnt onto the new piece as the candle heats the parchment. Once all the messages from the blue flame have been transcribed onto new parchment in this way, the orange flame winks out.
