⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Gentleman's Saber
Weapon (a longsword or scimitar), rare (requires attunement)
___

This elegant blade has a gently curved handle and a guard in the shape of a shield. Even if you aren't attuned to the sword, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and if you make an opportunity attack with the weapon and hit, the target takes an extra 1d6 slashing damage from the attack.

If you're attuned to the weapon, the weapon's shield-like guard changes its design to match your family crest. In addition, the sword has 3 charges, which you can use only if you're attuned to it. When you're hit by a ranged attack while holding the sword, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to hold the blade in front of you. Roll a d6. A domed, spectral barrier appears from the blade's tip, granting you a bonus to AC against ranged attacks equal to the number rolled on the d6 until the start of your next turn, including against the triggering attack. The sword regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
