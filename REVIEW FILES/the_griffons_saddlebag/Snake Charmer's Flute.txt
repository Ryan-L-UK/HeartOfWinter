Snake Charmer's Flute
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

You must be proficient with wind instruments to use this flute. While you are attuned to the flute, ordinary snakes are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. For the purposes of this item, this includes flying snakes, poisonous snakes, and constrictor snakes, although swarms and giant versions of such creatures have a 50 percent chance of being indifferent to you instead.

You can use an action to play the flute. While you continue to play the flute each round as an action, any snake that comes within 30 feet of you and isn't under another creature's control must make a Wisdom check contested by your Charisma check. If you lose the contest, the snake behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the flute's music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the snake is swayed by the flute's music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the instrument. A friendly snake obeys your mental commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly snake, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly snake starts its turn and can't hear the flute's music, your control over that snake ends, and the snake behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the flute's music for the next 24 hours. Your control over a snake ends early if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.
