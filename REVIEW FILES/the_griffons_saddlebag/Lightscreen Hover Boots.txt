Lightscreen Hover Boots
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

These hefty boots are miraculously light to walk in. As a bonus action, you can click your heels together while wearing the boots to hover 1 foot off the floor. You can move as normal while hovering in this way using your walking speed, skating above the ground on a plume of blue light. The light sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

As an action, you can speak the boots' command word to cause their light to shine brighter, emitting bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for another 40 feet until the end of your turn. As part of this action, you can immediately move up to your walking speed across any horizontal or vertical surface, including walls or upside down along ceilings. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks and leaves a trail of blue light behind you. At the end of this movement, the trail of light solidifies, becoming a radiant blue wall that extends perpendicularly from the surface on which you moved. The wall is translucent, 1/4 inch thick, and up to 10 feet tall. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by "dispel magic". A "disintegrate" spell destroys the wall instantly, however.

The wall lasts until the start of your next turn. Once you use this property, it can't be used again for 1d4 hours.
