💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Helm of the Broken Dragon
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a non-lawful dragonborn)
___

This helmet is made of harsh, angular shapes that come together into the shape of an aberrant dragon skull. Your scales twist into strange, fractal-like patterns tinged with otherworldly colors when you attune to this item. While wearing the helmet, you have resistance to psychic damage, and creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks against you. In addition, your breath weapon changes to be a plume of unearthly psionic energy, dealing psychic damage instead of its normal damage type. A creature in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw, instead of your breath weapon's normal save. On a failed save, a creature is also affected as by the "bane" spell for 1 minute as maddening whispers fill its mind. The creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against your breath weapon DC at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚. This helmet is cursed with gnawing insecurity and self-doubt. Attuning to the helmet curses you until you are targeted by the "remove curse" spell or similar magic. While cursed, you are unwilling to remove the helm, and you gain the following flaw: "Whatever course of action I take, there is a voice in my head that screams at me to do the opposite. The voice is never silent."
