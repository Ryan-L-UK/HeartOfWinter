💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Tub of Churning and Fermentation
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This squat wooden and ceramic tub has a screw-on lid that fits snuggly around its base. The tub seems to be able to hold about two gallons of liquid or one cubic foot of material within it. You can leave a liquid or other perishable in the tub and secure the lid before saying the name of the end result you'd like the contents to turn into. If you say the name of a possible result, the tub emits a slight click sound before locking its lid shut for ten minutes.

After ten minutes, the tub gives a second, louder click as the lid unlocks. The contents of the tub will have been stirred, processed, or otherwise fermented in such a way to generate the commanded end product. Adding additional ingredients into the tub can influence the end result's flavor.

Once the tub has been used in this way, it cannot be used again until the following dawn.
