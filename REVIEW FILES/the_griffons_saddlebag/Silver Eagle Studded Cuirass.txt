Silver Eagle Studded Cuirass
Armor (studded leather), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This studded leather armor is worn by an elite guard of a longstanding alliance between elves and humans. While you're wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.

In addition, when a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack while you're wearing this armor, you can use your reaction to speak its command word. When you do, a pair of ghostly eagle wings appear from the back of the armor. The wings beat the air around you and push you back up to 10 feet away from the attacking creature, without provoking attacks of opportunity. In addition, the sudden movement takes you out of harms way, reducing the damage you take from the attack by 2d6. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
