Dwarven Iron Axe Weapon (battleaxe), rare (requires attunement)
___

This hefty iron axe represents a commitment to order and law. At its top is a bust of a dwarven champion renowned for their battles against fey lords.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the axe to attack a fey (including creatures with the Fey Ancestry trait) or illusion. While holding the weapon, you can use an action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed.

𝙍𝙚𝙣𝙙 𝙄𝙡𝙡𝙪𝙨𝙞𝙤𝙣. The axe has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you make an attack roll against an illusion using the axe, the illusion is dispelled (as if by the "dispel magic" spell) if the total of the attack roll meets or exceeds 10 + the spell's level. An illusion created by a spell of 6th level or higher is unaffected. When an illusion is dispelled in this way, the axe loses 1 charge.
