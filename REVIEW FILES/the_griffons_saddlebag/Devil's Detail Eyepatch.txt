Devil's Detail Eyepatch
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This well worn leather eyepatch is enchanted with the illusion of a devil's eye on the front. While wearing this eyepatch over a missing eye, you can magically see as if you weren't missing one at all. The embroidered eye adorning the front of the patch swivels and moves as you look around while wearing it. You don't gain this benefit if you wear this patch over a working eye.

In addition, while wearing the eyepatch over a missing eye, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet for 1 hour. If you already have darkvision, this effect increases its range by 60 feet. While this property is in effect, you can see through magical darkness as if it were normal darkness. Once this property of the eyepatch has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.
