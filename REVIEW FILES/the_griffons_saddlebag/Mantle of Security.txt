💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Mantle of Security
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This soft cloak was once a child's beloved blanket and has been miraculously enchanted by their hopes and dreams. While worn as a cloak, you can't be frightened, and magic can’t put you to sleep. When unclasped, it can still be used as a warm blanket. When used as a blanket while sleeping or over the course of a short or long rest, you can't be unwillingly targeted by the "dream" spell, you gain a +3 bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score, and you can't be surprised as a result of being unconscious. Regardless of how the cloak is used, you can tolerate temperatures as low as −50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection.
