Weapon (greatsword), very rare

You must have a Strength score of 17 or higher to wield this titanic bladed fang. Harvested from a tarrasque—either living or dead—and given a makeshift handle, these blades are renowned for their sheer destructive force. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage to any object or structure it hits.
