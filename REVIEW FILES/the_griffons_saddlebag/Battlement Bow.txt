Battlement Bow
Weapon (any bow), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This magic bow is enchanted with passive abjuration protections. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using the bow, the bow creates a thin barrier of protective magic that stays between you and that creature until the start of your next turn. If you hit a different creature while protected by the barrier, the barrier moves to defend you against the new target instead. While the barrier is protecting you against a creature in this way, you're considered to have half cover against that creature's ranged attacks and spell effects.
