Bow of the Cobra
Weapon (any bow), rare (requires attunement)
___

This metallic bow resembles the shape of a mighty cobra and is covered in spots of patina. When you fire an arrow from the bow, you can choose to coat the arrow in a thin layer of acid. A target hit with the acid-coated arrow takes an extra 1d4 acid damage. Hit or miss, a nonmagical coated arrow is destroyed after the attack.

In addition, the bow has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. When you take the Attack action using this bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to replace one of your weapon attacks with a special attack. This special attack duplicates the effect of the "acid arrow" spell and uses the same attack bonus as your normal weapon attacks with the bow.
