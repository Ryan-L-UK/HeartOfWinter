⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Lance of the Statuemaker Weapon (lance), very rare
___

This lance is made of a stalactite mounted to a brass handle. Its razor-fine point is made of pitch-dark jet. Despite its material, the weapon magically weighs the same as a normal lance. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points using the lance and choose to knock the creature out instead of killing it, you can leave the lance embedded within the creature as part of the attack. When you do, the target is petrified until another creature uses an action to make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check to pull out the lance or frees it with a "greater restoration" spell or similar magic, at which point the lance falls to the ground. Once a creature has been petrified in this way, it can't be petrified by the lance again until 7 days have passed.
