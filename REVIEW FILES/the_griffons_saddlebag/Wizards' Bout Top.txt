Wizards' Bout Top Wondrous item, common
___

This wooden top is a favorite among children in the wizard city of Orostead, who use them in a local favorite game of Wizards' Bout. Many children repaint their tops to fit their personal aesthetic. You can spin the top using an action; roll a d8 and use the table below to determine the illusory effect created by the top. The effects are instantaneous.

d8  |  Illusory Effect — 1 | A burst of light flashes, followed by fading sparkles. 2 | Small vines grow up and around the top. 3 | The ground under the top rumbles and cracks, like an earthquake. 4 | A frigid whirlpool encircles the top. 5 | A viper coils around the top and strikes out. 6 | A sharp sound, like a whip, radiates from the top. 7 | A small pillar of flame flares upward from the top. 8 | A swirling breeze stirs around the top.

To play a game of Wizards' Bout, another creature must also spin a different "Wizards' Bout top" within 5 feet of you before the start of your next turn. When playing Wizard's Bout, a Tiny, illusory wizard appears above each top when it's spun, which then casts a magical spell against the opposing top. Each player has 10 points at the start of a game of Wizards' Bout, which are subsequently lost and gained depending on the tops' effects. You lose when you have 0 points at the start of your turn, or win if you start with 20 points or more. Refer to the table below [or in this post's second image] to determine the top's additional effects when playing a game of Wizards' Bout.

Both players take turns spinning their tops. Each round is called a bout, and the tops' effects are resolved simultaneously at the end of each bout (even if one player spun their top first). Each effect is associated with a unique element. If that element trumps the one rolled by the opposing player, the opposing top's effect is negated.
