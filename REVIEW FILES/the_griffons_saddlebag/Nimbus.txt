Nimbus, First Staff of the Thunderbirds
Staff, artifact (requires attunement)
___

This ancient staff was created when a piece of driftwood was struck by lightning, fusing it to a twisted length of glass made from the sand on which it laid. Revered by the Rocborne nomads and other worldly travelers, this one-of-a-kind crook carries with it the power of storms, tempests, and the wind spirits that control them. When it appears, it falls from the sky in the eye of a storm or a flash of lightning.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. In addition, when you attack with the staff, you can choose to make a special ranged attack with it instead. This attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Wisdom modifier to its attack and damage rolls. On a hit, it deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage as a gust of magical wind batters the target.

𝙑𝙖𝙧𝙞𝙖𝙣𝙩 𝙋𝙧𝙤𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙚𝙨. Some properties of this artifact are locked behind layers of dormant magic. As you grow stronger and reach certain milestones, these properties may become available to you. This staff can have up to 3 of the following properties active at a time. When you attune to 'Nimbus', you can choose to activate up to 3 of its variant properties whose prerequisites you meet. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace any of the activated properties with another one.

○ The staff can be used as a 'broom of flying'.

○ (Prerequisite: 5th level) While holding the staff, you can use a bonus action to cast the "shillelagh" spell with it.
