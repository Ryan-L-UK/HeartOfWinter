💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Green Knight’s Vow
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

These dark green adamantine and copper bracers are granted to devout warriors of the Infernal Court and are designed to match their army's signature tower shields. While wearing the bracers, you grow a sweeping pair of horns from your forehead if you are not a tiefling. If your attunement to the bracers ends, the horns crack and fall away after 24 hours.

The bracers have a total of 7 charges and regain all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing them, you can expend 1 or more of their charges to use the following three properties:

"𝘽𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙚 𝙔𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚𝙡𝙫𝙚𝙨!" As a bonus action, you can expend 2 or more charges from the bracers to provide cover to a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. For 2 charges, you summon a large, spectral shield that follows the creature for the duration, providing it with half cover. You can summon one extra shield for each additional charge you expend, targeting a different creature with each one. The shields fade at the end of your next turn.

"𝙋𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝘼𝙨𝙨𝙖𝙪𝙡𝙩!" When you make an opportunity attack, you can expend 1 or more of the bracers' charges to embolden your nearby allies. For each charge you spend, one creature of your choice within 60 feet of you can use its reaction to make one weapon attack. The chosen creatures must be able to see or hear you.

"𝙔𝙤𝙪 𝙒𝙞𝙡𝙡 𝘽𝙪𝙧𝙣!" You can expend 1 or more charges from the bracers to cast the "hellish rebuke" spell (save DC 15) from them. For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend. The fire from this spell is a haunting emerald green.

𝙁𝙡𝙖𝙬. The "Green Knight's vow" makes its wearer tremendously loyal to royalty. While attuned to the bracers, you gain the following flaw: "I will stand by my sovereign leader, no matter what." You or your GM determine who your leader is. In addition, if you are attuned to the bracers for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to duty drives you to the brink of zealotry...
