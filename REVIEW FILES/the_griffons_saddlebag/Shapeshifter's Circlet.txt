Shapeshifter's Circlet
Wondrous item, common
___

This ivory circlet allows you to recreate some of the natural features of other creatures. While wearing the circlet, you can spend 1 minute to gently massage your ears, forehead, or temples. When you do, you can choose to create one of the following features or effects:
.
• You can cover or replace your own ears with the form of another creature's.
• You can summon one or more horns or antlers atop your head.
• You can change the appearance of your eyes, including their color and pupil shape.

You can only have 1 of these effects active at a time. The effects lasts until you dismiss it as a bonus action, remove the circlet, or fall unconscious. You don't gain any of the senses or abilities of another creature by recreating its physical features in this way.
