Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

While holding this large shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. The bonus becomes +2 while you have at least 1 temporary hit point. While you have temporary hit points, the shield emits a slight blue glow.

In addition, you can channel the heroic resolve within the shield using an action to gain 1d6+8 temporary hit points. Once you've used this ability, you can't use it again until the following dawn.
