Bow of the Eldritch Archer
Weapon (shortbow), rare (requires attunement)
___

This unearthly bow is disjointed and gruesome. It's made of an ashen, twisted wood that acts as a conduit for eldritch energy and has a series of fleshy tendril-like growths that bulge through the wood's grain. Arrows shot from this bow are destroyed once they're fired, turning into a projectile of pure energy instead. This projectile deals 1d10 force damage, instead of the arrow's normal damage, and retains any magical properties of the destroyed arrow. Hit or miss, a projectile is lost after the attack.

These energy projectiles can sometimes pierce enemies. Once on each of your turns when you make an attack using this weapon, you can force another creature 5 feet directly behind the original target to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes1d10 force damage.
