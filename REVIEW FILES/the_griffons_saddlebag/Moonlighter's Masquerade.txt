💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Moonlighter's Masquerade Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This midnight blue mask has been delicately gilded with swirling designs. While wearing it, you can use an action to don an illusory outfit of finery. You choose the appearance of the outfit each time, and you can change the colors of the mask as part of this illusion. The outfit magically hides any armor or clothes you're already wearing, provided that the armor doesn't normally impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. The illusion remains until you dismiss it (no action required) or until you're no longer wearing the mask.

If you're wearing the mask between dusk and dawn, you can also use an action to cast the "charm person" spell (save DC 13) from it. The spell ends early if you successfully charm another creature with it in this way or if the mask is removed. When the spell ends on a creature or if it succeeds on the saving throw, that creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
