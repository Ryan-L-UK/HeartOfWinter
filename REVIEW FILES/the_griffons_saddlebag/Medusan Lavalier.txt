Wondrous item, rare
___

This pair of metallic snakes forms a twisting necklace that hangs around your neck. It coils and moves almost imperceptibly, keeping latched together at the nape of your neck where the snakes' tails intertwine. You can wear or remove the necklace using an action. While wearing this necklace, you can't become petrified or otherwise turned to stone against your will. If you are already petrified or turning to stone when you wear the necklace, the effect is suppressed until you remove it, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
