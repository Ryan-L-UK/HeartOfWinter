Bag of Gifts Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This soft bag is decorated with tiny illustrations of small trinkets and gifts. Striped ribbons line its side and an empty paper tag hangs from its drawstring. The bag is 6 inches across but weighs just over 12 pounds, even if nothing is kept inside it.

While holding the empty bag, you can use an action to cinch its top closed and lightly shake it. When you do, the bag magically feels full. When a creature other than you opens the bag, roll a d12 and use the table below to determine what the gift is inside.

| d12 | Gift | — | 1 | A small bottle of sweet berry juice that is irresistible to mundane insects when poured out. | | 2 | A palm-sized lantern that magically glows in a variety of colors to reflect your mood while held. | | 3 | A bag of 10 seeds that, when grown, produce flowers that emit a beautiful, melodic chorus in the wind. The flowers have a 50 percent chance to regrow each year, but never produce new seeds. | | 4 | A decorative teacup that magically prevents tea from being oversteeped in it. | | 5 | A pair of eyeglasses that create a loud popping sound whenever you cross your eyes while wearing them. | | 6 | A fist-sized ball that bounces back up exactly as high as it was dropped, up to 10 feet high. | | 7 | A pair of nondescript socks that are always dry when worn and smell of lavender. | | 8 | A paper fan that shows a different painted landscape each time it's opened. | | 9 | A chunk of waxy honeycomb that never loses its sweet flavor when chewed. | | 10 | A silk scarf that flutters dramatically in even the slightest breeze. | | 11 | An empty snowglobe whose snow changes to pollen in the spring, petals in the summer, and leaves in the autumn. | | 12 | A brass bracelet with a timepiece attached that can only tell the time while outside. |

Each time that a gift is received from the bag, the bag becomes 1 pound lighter, and the item is removed from the list. If you roll an item on the list that's already been received by a creature, you instead get the item listed in the nearest available row. Once a creature opens a "bag of gifts", it can't open another one in...
