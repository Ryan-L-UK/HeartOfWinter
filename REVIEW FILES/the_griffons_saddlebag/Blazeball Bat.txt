Blazeball Bat Weapon (club or greatclub), rare
___

This wooden club is held together by iron rings and smolders with crackling embers while held. When you hit a target with a melee attack using this magic weapon, that target takes an extra 1d4 fire damage.

You can use an action while holding the club to speak its command phrase. A ball of fire condenses from the weapon's embers and leaps into the air in front of you. You then strike the ball of fire with the club, launching it toward a target that you can see within range. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target, using your Strength modifier for the attack roll. This special attack has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 + 5 fire damage. Hit or miss, the target and each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. A creature has advantage on the saving throw if the attack was made at long range.

If you roll a 1 when you make this special attack, the ball of fire lands at your feet and detonates. You take 1d8 + 5 fire damage, and each creature within 10 feet of you (including yourself) must also succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage.
