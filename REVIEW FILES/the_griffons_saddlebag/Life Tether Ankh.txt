💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Life Tether Ankh
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

While wearing this necklace, you can choose to succeed on a death saving throw you would have otherwise failed (no action required). If you use the ankh in this way when suffering two failed death saving throws, you instead gain one success and one failure. Once the ankh has been used to succeed on a death saving throw, it shatters and is destroyed.
