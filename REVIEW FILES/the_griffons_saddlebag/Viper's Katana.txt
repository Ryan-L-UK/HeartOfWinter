⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Viper's Katana Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)
___

This menacing curved blade is detailed with hundreds of metallic scales and has a serpentine hilt. When you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 1d6 poison damage. This weapon has the finesse property.

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to deal no damage to it. You make this decision after determining that the attack hits, but before rolling the damage for it. Instead, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn. If the target was surprised, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. When the poison ends, the creature takes 2d8 piercing damage and 2d6 poison damage, as if a great serpent had suddenly struck it. Once a creature has been poisoned in this way, it automatically succeeds on its saving throw against this property for the next 24 hours.
