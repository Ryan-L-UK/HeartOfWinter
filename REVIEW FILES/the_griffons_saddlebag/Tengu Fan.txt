Tengu Fan Wondrous item, rare
___

Typically carried by oni, a "tengu fan" functions as a "wind fan" with the following changes:

• Its save DC is 15, instead of 13.

• It can be used twice before the next dawn, instead of once, without the risk of destroying it. However, when it's used for a third time or more, the cumulative chance to be destroyed is 50 percent, instead of 20.

• When used to cast the "gust of wind" spell, razor-sharp leaves fill the line of wind. A creature that fails the saving throw against the wind at the start of its turn also takes 2d4 slashing damage from the sharp leaves. On a successful save, the creature instead takes half as much slashing damage.

• The fan can also be used as a magic sickle with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
