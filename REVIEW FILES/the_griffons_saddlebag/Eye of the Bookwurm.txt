💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Eye of the Bookwurm 
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This small, glass sphere is enchanted with weak divination magics to help you find specific words or phrases in writing. It has a stylized iris etched into the glass.

You can use a bonus action to speak the Eye's command word aloud, followed by the word or phrase you're searching for. The word or phrase magically appears and floats within the sphere. By holding the Eye in a free hand, your vision becomes magically enhanced to subconsciously highlight the word or phrase you searched for in a green light whenever you see it. Once you've used the Eye's ability for the first time, you can change the word or phrase as many times as you like for the next hour, after which the item can not be used again until the following dawn.
