💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Permanent Parchment
Wondrous item, common
___

This violet piece of parchment is smooth and pleasant to write on. You can speak the parchment's command words "lock" or "unlock" as a bonus action to lock or unlock the parchment, respectively. While locked, the sheet cannot be destroyed or damaged by nonmagical means, and any ink already on the page can't be removed, smeared, or otherwise changed without the use of magic. New ink added to a locked sheet of the parchment runs off the page like water. While unlocked, the parchment behaves like a nonmagical sheet of paper.

While unlocked, you can speak the command word "clear" to cause any ink on the sheet of paper to magically evaporate without leaving any marks behind.

The language the parchment's command words must be spoken in is determined by the creator of the parchment.
