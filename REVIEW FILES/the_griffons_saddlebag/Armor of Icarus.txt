Armor of Icarus
Armor (breastplate), rare (requires attunement)
___

This sculpted breastplate has a pair of small mechanical wings attached to its back. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. The armor has 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the armor, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to magically unfurl the mechanical wings and fly up to 60 feet in a straight line toward a point of bright light that you can see (such as a torch, "light" spell, or the sun) without provoking opportunity attacks. The wings remain unfurled until you touch the ground, during which time you fall at a rate of 30 feet per round and gain a flying speed of 30 feet, which you can use to glide horizontally as you descend. While gliding in this way, you cannot fly upwards unless you use the armor to fly toward a point of bright light again. When you land on the ground while falling in this way, the mechanical wings refold themselves to your back, and you take no damage from falling.
