⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Club of Dancing
Weapon (club), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This metallic club emits prismatic flashes of light whenever it hits a target. While you're holding this weapon, you can use an action to cast the "dancing lights" spell from it. In addition, the club has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dusk. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can expend 1 of its charges to deal an extra 1d6 thunder damage. If the target is a creature, it must also make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, that creature's speed becomes 0 until the start of your next turn, and it spends its action on its next turn dancing in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering.
