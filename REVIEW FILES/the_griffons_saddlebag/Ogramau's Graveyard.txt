💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Ogramau's Graveyard
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a cleric or wizard)
___

This glass orb has a miniature graveyard inside and has a base made from a hollowed humanoid skull. It's roughly fist-sized and weighs 1 pound. While the orb is on your person, undead creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you're holding the orb, you can use an action to speak one of its two command words.

The first command word shunts a Medium or Small humanoid corpse that you can see within 5 feet of you into a special demiplane contained within the orb. A corpse within this demiplane doesn't age, effectively extending the time limit on raising it from the dead. If you shunt a second corpse into the demiplane while another one is there, the first corpse reappears in the space left behind by the new one.

The second command word duplicates the effect of the "animate dead" spell, using a corpse stored within the orb's demiplane as the target of the spell. A skeleton or zombie created in this way appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 15 feet of you and turns to dust and is destroyed after either 24 hours have passed or it drops to 0 hit points. If you speak this command word again to create a second skeleton or zombie while the first one remains, the first skeleton or zombie turns to dust and is destroyed when the new one appears.
