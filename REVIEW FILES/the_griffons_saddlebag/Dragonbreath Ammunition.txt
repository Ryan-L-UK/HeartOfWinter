Dragonbreath Ammunition
Weapon (an arrow or bolt), rare
___

This metallic ammunition flies effortlessly on its own when fired. When you take the attack action to make a ranged weapon attack, you can instead fire this ammunition at a point you can see within range. The arrow or bolt explodes when it reaches the point, destroying the ammunition and creating either a cone or 5-foot-wide line of dragon's breath in the direction it was fired. The created effect depends on the metal it was cast from. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 damage of the associated type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Use the table below to determine the effect's area of effect and damage type:

Ammunition Metal | Area | Damage Type
-
Brass | 60-foot line | Fire
-
Bronze | 90-foot line | Lightning
-
Copper | 60-foot line | Acid
-
Gold | 60-foot cone | Fire
-
Silver | 60-foot cone | Cold
