⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Sword of Sacrifice Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)
___

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks to wound yourself with the sword instead. When you do, you take 1d6 + 1 necrotic damage, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way. Then, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature becomes cursed by the sword for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). The curse ends early if you end one of your subsequent turns without attacking the creature with the sword. Whenever you hit the cursed creature with the sword, it takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage from the attack. If you slay a cursed creature with the sword, you regain 1d6 + 1 hit points. Dying doesn't end your attunement to the sword.

𝙎𝙖𝙘𝙧𝙞𝙛𝙞𝙘𝙚. As an action, or when you're reduced to 0 hit points (no action required), you can use the sword to end your life in an act of total sacrifice. When you do, you are killed outright, but the sword becomes a "dancing sword" that you magically control on your initiative count, as if you were alive and not incapacitated. The sword uses your attack bonus and ability modifier for its attack and damage rolls, and it has a +1 bonus to those rolls. The sword drops to the ground next to you and becomes a normal "sword of sacrifice" after 1 minute or if you're returned to life. Making more than four attacks with the "dancing sword" doesn't end the effect early. The sword deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target it hits for the duration. Once you've used this property of the sword, you can't do so again.
