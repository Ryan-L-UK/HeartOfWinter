Cube of Teleportation
Wondrous item, rare
___

This hefty, metal cube is about 6 inches on a side and weighs 3 pounds. One of the cube's sides looks like a metallic stamp, and is made of countless interlocking and shifting panels that reconfigure themselves to magically generate a new, unique sigil sequence daily at dawn, as described in the "teleportation circle" spell. Its five other sides are flat and blank, or, at the GM's discretion, have up to 5 different sigil sequences recorded onto them.

If you find a permanent teleportation circle, you can place and hold one of the cube's flat sides against the circle for 1 hour, focusing on it for the duration (as if concentrating on a spell). If you hold and focus on the cube for the full duration, the circle's sigil sequence is recorded onto the cube's face. If a sigil was already on the cube's face, it's replaced by the new one.

The cube has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you hold one of the cube's recorded sigil sequences on the ground face-down and focus on it for 1 minute (as if concentrating on a spell), the cube expends 1 of its charges and duplicates the effect of the "teleportation circle" spell, using the sigil sequence from the cube's face to form the spell's teleportation circle on the ground below it.

Alternatively, you can hold the stamp side of the cube on the ground and focus on it for 1 minute (as if concentrating on a spell). If you hold and focus on the cube for the full duration, it magically applies its unique sigil sequence onto the ground in a 10-foot-diameter teleportation circle, provided that there's enough space to do so. This circle remains for 1 hour, and can only be used as a destination circle for the duration. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn, unless you use an action to expend 1 of the cube's charges to generate a new sigil sequence and regain the use of this property. Once you've placed a unique teleportation circle in this way, you can use this side of the cube as if it were a normal sigil sequence recording for the generated circle.
