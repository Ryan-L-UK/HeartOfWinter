Salamander Flame Gauntlets
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

These dark metal gauntlets were forged using fire from the heart of a salamander. While wearing them, your unarmed strikes with your hands deal an extra 1d4 fire damage to any target they hit. In addition, you can use a bonus action to cast the "flame blade" spell (4th-level version, no concentration required) from the gauntlets, using either your spellcasting ability or your choice of Strength or Dexterity for the spellcasting ability of the spell when you do.

While holding the fiery blade, you can use an action to make a ranged spell attack with it instead. When you do, the blade becomes a fiery spear with a range of 30 feet. On a hit, the spear deals 4d6 fire damage. Immediately after the attack, the fiery blade reforms in your hand.
