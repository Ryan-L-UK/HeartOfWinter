⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Tether Tearer
Weapon (any axe), uncommon
___

This silver axe can temporarily bind a creature to its corporeal form. This axe deals an extra 1d6 force damage to any creature it hits that has the "incorporeal movement" trait. When it does, that creature can't benefit from its "incorporeal movement" trait again until the end of its next turn.
