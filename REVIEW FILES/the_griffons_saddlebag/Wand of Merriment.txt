Wand of Merriment
Wand, very rare (requires attunement)
___

This wand is made from a sprig of holly and exudes an unmistakable aura of cheer from it. It has 10 holly berries that each contain 1 charge and are used to fuel the wand's properties. When you expend a charge from a berry, it wilts away and disappears. The wand regrows 1d6 + 4 missing berries daily at dawn. While you're attuned to the wand, you gain a +2 bonus to Charisma checks and saving throws.

𝙎𝙥𝙚𝙡𝙡𝙨. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend one or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using a spell save DC of 16: "create food and water" (3 charges), "goodberry" (1 charge), "hideous laughter" (1 charge), or "irresistible dance" (6 charges).

𝘿𝙖𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙏𝙝𝙧𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙎𝙣𝙤𝙬. While holding the wand, you can use a bonus action to expend 2 of its charges to take the Dash action. When you do, you ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow.
.
𝙁𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙫𝙚. As an action, you can wave this wand over up to 1 gallon of water and expend 1 charge to transform the liquid into a weak, but pleasant-tasting, alcoholic beverage.
.
If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, all but one of the wand's leaves and berry stems wither away and die. When this happens, the wand becomes a common wand that does not require attunement, but has only 1 charge. This common version of the wand retains only the festive property of its original form and regains the expended charge daily at dawn.
