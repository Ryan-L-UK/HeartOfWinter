Weapon (crossbow, hand), rare
___

This curious contraption is in fact a small, surreptitious hand crossbow that can be worn on a wrist or forearm and does not require a free hand in order to use it. When you roll for initiative and are not surprised, you can immediately use a reaction to fire the weapon at a creature you can see within range using the statistics for a regular hand crossbow. If the bolt is not fired in this way, you can use a bonus action immediately after taking the Attack action on a following turn to make a single weapon attack with the crossbow.

In order to use this crossbow, you must also wear two rings on adjacent fingers. One ring carries a thin but flexible string that connects to the firing mechanism of the crossbow. The second ring is equipped with a very small but functional blade which is used to sever the first's string. When the string is severed, the crossbow fires.

It takes one minute to reset the crossbow and rings. The crossbow can be fired twice each day, resetting at dawn, before the crossbow's mechanism jams from overuse.
