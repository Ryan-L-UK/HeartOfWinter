Spire Seed
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
___

This large tree seed is 1 foot long and surrounded in a protective cone. If you're attuned to seed and plant the cone in soil, it takes root and begins to rapidly grow. It takes 1 month for the seed to fully grow. If you are dead for more than 1 minute or are on another plane of existence than the seed for more than 1 day while it grows, the tree dies and the seed is destroyed.

The stem of the seed's cone is vaguely key-shaped. When planted, the stem breaks off in your hand. While you're attuned to the seed, the stem magically remains on your person at all times.

Once fully grown, the "spire tree" is 300 feet tall with a 20-foot radius. It tapers gently inward towards the top of the tree. At the base of this magic tree is a door large enough for Medium creatures to enter. The door is guarded by a dryad who is loyal to you and any creature you choose. The dryad accepts the seed's stem as proof of ownership and uses it as a key to open the door. Once opened, your attunement to the seed ends, the tree belongs to you, and both you and other allies you designate to the dryad can enter and leave the tree at will. Your attunement to the seed does not end if you are more than 100 feet away from it, and can only be ended early by a "wish" spell. If it does, the key disintegrates and the door cannot be opened.

Inside the tree are 10 floors. You choose how to distribute the floors throughout the tree. A wooden spiral staircase climbs upward through the center of the tree and floors. Each floor has 10 small windows that can't be seen from outside the tree. In addition, the interior of the tree can't be the target of divination magic or entered by teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.

The canopy of the tree extends 30 feet beyond the base of the tree. Soil beneath the tree's canopy is exceptionally rich and fertile.

The tree has 500 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons that aren't siege weapons, and resistance to siege weapons and all other damage. The door has 100 hit points instead.
