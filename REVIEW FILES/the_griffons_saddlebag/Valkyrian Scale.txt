Valkyrian Scale Armor (scale mail), rare (requires attunement)
___

The large scales of this armor resemble feathers, which are actually part of magical metal wings that curl around your torso to protect you. While wearing the armor, you can use a bonus action to cause the wings to unfurl and extend from the armor, allowing you to fly up to 30 feet using your movement. You fall to the ground at the end of your turn or when you stop moving in this way.

You gain a +2 bonus to your Constitution score, up to a maximum of 20, while wearing this armor. In addition, when a creature that you can see within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically reduce that damage by 1d8. You take the same amount of damage that was reduced in this way, which ignores resistance and immunity. Record the damage taken in this way, which resets to 0 when you finish a long rest.

Any damage you take using this property of the armor is magically converted into energy by the wings. If you have no more than half your hit points left, you can attack up to two targets using the wings as an action, provided that the targets are each within 5 feet of you. This special weapon attack has a +7 bonus to hit. On a hit, a target takes force damage equal to the total amount of damage you reduced using the wings. Hit or miss, the recorded damage resets to 0 at the end of this action. This attack doesn't interrupt your flight using the armor's wings.
