Chromatic Obsidian Greateaxe
Weapon (greataxe), rare (requires attunement)
___

This prismatic greataxe is made using chromatic obsidian, a dazzling type of stone found where several Elemental Planes meet. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this magic weapon, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A target takes 1d6 cold damage, 1d6 fire damage, 1d6 lightning damage, and 1d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Roll the damage dice separately, recording any 6 you roll. For each 6 you roll in this way, use the table below to determine which of the following effects happen.

Damage type | Effect
-
Cold | The target's speed is halved until the end of your next turn.
-
Fire | The target takes an extra 6 fire damage at the end of its next turn.
-
Lightning | The target can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.
-
Radiant | The next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage.
