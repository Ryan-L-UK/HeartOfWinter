💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Inker's Armband
Wondrous item, common
___

This brushed metal bracelet is lined with a magical black ink. The ink only stains skin and slides harmlessly off of clothing. While wearing the bracelet, you can use a bonus action to cause magical tattoos to appear on the arm that's wearing it. The tattoos remain until you remove the bracelet or use a bonus action to end the effect or change their appearance. These tattoos can either be still or magically animated in a slow loop that repeats every 6 seconds. Regardless of the tattoo, the armband only produces black ink.
