Cherry Blossom Wand Wand, common
___

This wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. As an action while holding the wand, you can expend 1 of its charges to target a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. The air in a 20-foot cube centered on that point stirs into a light, dramatic breeze that carries a flurry of delicate pink cherry blossoms on it. The wind and the blossoms vanish immediately at the end of your turn.
