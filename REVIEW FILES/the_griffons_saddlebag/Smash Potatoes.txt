Smash Potatoes 
Wondrous item, common
___

This hearty root vegetable is grown by the clerics and champions of Kord, whose strength is said to make its way onto the Material Plane through their gardens. Eating one of these vaguely fist-shaped potatoes will cause your hands to itch for the thrill of combat. For each potato you eat, your normal unarmed damage increases to 1d4 for one hour. You can eat up to 3 potatoes per day before needing to finish a long rest to benefit from them again. If you already have an unarmed combat die that is 1d4 or higher this vegetable has no affect, but is nonetheless delicious.
