Blue Vanguard’s Glory
Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), very rare (requires attunement by a creature with a Constitution of 17 or higher)
___

This brilliant deep blue armor is the bulwark for the king’s royal front rank. While you have more than half your Hit Dice remaining, you can spend 1 of them as a bonus action to gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

This armor has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

"𝘼𝙩 𝙔𝙤𝙪!" If you move at least 10 feet straight toward a target while wearing this armor, you can use a bonus action to expend up to 5 of its charges to move up to 10 more feet toward the target. If you hit the target with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, it must also succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. For each charge you spend in this way beyond the first, you can move an additional 5 feet toward the target, and on a hit, the save DC is increased by 1.

"𝘽𝙖𝙘𝙠, 𝘾𝙪𝙧!" When you hit a Large or smaller target with a melee weapon attack while wearing this armor, you can choose to expend up to 5 of its charges to push the creature 10 feet away from you. For each charge you spend in this way beyond the first, the target is pushed an additional 5 feet away from you. If the pushed target is stopped by a solid surface, the target takes an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 5 feet of movement it had left to move before it was stopped. If the target is pushed into another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage.
