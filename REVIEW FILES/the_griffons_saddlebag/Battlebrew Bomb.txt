💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Battlebrew Bomb Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This fist-sized keg contains 1 ounce of extremely old dwarven liquor which is as strong as it is explosive. A built-in locking mechanism keeps the barrel sealed until it's ready to be used. You can use an action to twist the sides of the keg and throw it at a point that you can see up to 20 feet away from you, splitting the keg open on impact and spraying the area with a fine mist of the liquor. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 poison damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The next time that a target that was sprayed by the liquor takes fire damage within 1 minute, it takes an extra 2d8 fire damage as the liquor ignites.
