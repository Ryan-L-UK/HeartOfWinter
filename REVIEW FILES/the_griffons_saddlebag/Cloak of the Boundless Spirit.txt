💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Cloak of the Boundless Spirit
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This swirling, translucent cloak bolsters the fighting spirits of those around it. The cloak has three charges and regains all expended charges each day at dawn. When an ally you can see within 15 feet of you takes damage, you can use a reaction to expend one these charges to reduce the damage by 2d6.

In addition, friendly creatures within 15 feet of you regain consciousness on a roll of 19 or 20 on death saving throws. When a creature regains consciousness in this way, you can use a reaction to expend a charge and grant them an additional 2d6 temporary hit points. Once a creature regains consciousness by rolling a 19 on a death saving throw, it cannot do so again until it finishes a long rest.
