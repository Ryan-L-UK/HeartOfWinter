⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Daybreaker Katana Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement)
___

This curved blade is a dusky metal with gilded waves dancing along its edge. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature gains a mark from the blade. If you attack a different creature or attack using a different weapon, all of the marks disappear. When a creature gains its third mark, it takes 3d6 radiant damage and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is blinded until the end of your next turn, and it can't be blinded in this way again for 24 hours. A creature with the Sunlight Sensitivity or Sunlight Hypersensitivity trait has disadvantage on this saving throw. Regardless of whether the creature succeeds on or fails the saving throw, it then loses all marks.
