Shooting Star
Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)
___

Tiny specks of starlight gleam from the dark surface of this magic longbow at night. The bow is strung with an invisible string that appears only when it's drawn. When pulled, the string emits a soft yellow glow as motes of starlight appear and float around the bow's frame. Drawing the bow without first nocking an arrow creates a magic arrow of pure starlight in its place and intensifies the bow's glow. The starlit arrow shines bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon when you use a starlit arrow, which deals radiant damage instead of piercing damage. Hit or miss, the starlit arrow disappears immediately after the attack.

𝙁𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙎𝙩𝙖𝙧𝙨. As an action, you can speak the bow's command word and fire a starlit arrow into the air above you, choosing a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. The arrow immediately vanishes and creates a shower of tiny, magical stars that fall and land in a 30-foot-radius circle on the ground centered on the point you chose. Each creature of your choice within the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 3d6 radiant damage and 3d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one, as a shower of magical stars slam into the ground around them. This property can't be used again until the next dusk.

In addition, when you use a starlit arrow and roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, a tiny magical star appears and strikes the target. The target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 radiant damage and 1d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Immediately after a falling star hits the ground or a target, it disappears.
