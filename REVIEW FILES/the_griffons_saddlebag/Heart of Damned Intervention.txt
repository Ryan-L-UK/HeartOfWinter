💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Heart of Damned Intervention
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)
___

This large infernal heart was torn from a powerful archdevil and is 1 foot tall and weighs 10 pounds. It still pulses, softly, and spews out small gouts of flame from an unquenchable fire within. The heart is hot to the touch and is wrapped by strange, writhing chains.

There is a glimmer of good in this heart that can be used to purify it. While attuned to the heart, you have resistance to fire damage, and you can cast the "hellish rebuke" spell as a 2nd-level spell at will.

Curse. This heart can only be purified and destroyed by a powerful celestial or deity, and attuning to it overwhelms your heart with its evil desires. The heart is cursed, and attuning to it extends the curse to you. When you attune to the heart, the heart's flames turn pitch black as it painfully sears into your body, taking the place of your own heart, and taints your connection to the gods. You take 15d6 necrotic damage, leaving chain-shaped scars across your torso, and your alignment becomes evil if it wasn't already. While cursed, you and other creatures within 100 feet of you are unable to magically communicate with any god, and any radiant damage you deal becomes necrotic damage instead. In addition, you can understand and speak Infernal and have disadvantage on attack rolls against devils and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.

If you die while cursed in this way, your soul is bound to the lower planes and can only be restored to life by a wish spell or divine intervention. Only a god or a "wish" spell cast by a good-aligned creature can end this curse, destroying the "heart of damned intervention" and restoring your original heart and connection to the gods.
