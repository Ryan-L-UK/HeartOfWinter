Dealmaker's Ring Ring, common
___

A silver piece has been pressed and shaped into this magic ring. A pair of outstretched hands reach across the surface of the ring towards the center. When you make a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check with another humanoid and offer out your hand for a handshake, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
