⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Jo'Catian Denier
Weapon (a scimitar, shortsword, or longsword), uncommon (requires attunement by a neutral-aligned creature)
___

This magic weapon comes from a clan of sentient wurms that debilitate their foes with strange magic. This sword has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with the sword, you can expend 1 of its charges as part of the attack to force that creature to make a DC 13 saving throw of your choice. On a failed save, a creature is subjected to an effect based on the kind of saving throw it made:
• 𝙎𝙩𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙜𝙩𝙝. The creature gains a -2 penalty to attack rolls until the end of its next turn.
• 𝘿𝙚𝙭𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙩𝙮. The creature's movement speed is halved until the end of its next turn.
• 𝘾𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙩𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. If the creature is Large or smaller, it loses its balance and is pushed 5 feet away from you.
• 𝙄𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙡𝙡𝙞𝙜𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚. The creature has disadvantage on the next spell attack it makes within 1 minute.
• 𝙒𝙞𝙨𝙙𝙤𝙢. The creature becomes slightly sluggish and can't take reactions until the end of its next turn.
• 𝘾𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙞𝙨𝙢𝙖. The creature has disadvantage on attacks against creatures other than you until the end of its next turn.

𝙒𝙞𝙜𝙜𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘾𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙜𝙚𝙨. While you're attuned to this weapon as well as the Jo'Catian rebuker, you can use charges from either item to fuel this weapon's properties.
