💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Efreeti Bangles Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
___

While wearing these iron and brass bangles, you can use a bonus action to speak their command word to cause your arms to become ensconced in flames. The flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet, and last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. The flames are harmless to you.

While your arms are alight, the first target you hit with a melee attack on a turn takes an extra 3d6 fire damage from the attack, and any creature that you grapple or are grappled by takes the same amount of fire damage at the start of each of its turns for the grapple's duration. In addition, while you have at least one hand free, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet, using your arms to propel your flight. If both of your hands are free, the flying speed is doubled.
