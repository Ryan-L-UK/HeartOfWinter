Grass Carpet
Wondrous item, common
___

This simple, soft roll of turf is magically fertile. Its soil is 1 inch thick and allows plants of all kinds to grow well within it. Each roll of turf is 5 feet wide and 10 feet long. Its grass and soil are self-containing and will not grow beyond the size of the carpet. The carpet is so fertile that plants growing in its soil require only half of the normal amount of sunlight and water that they normally would.

Every 1 inch of carpet soil depth provides the same amount of nutrition as normal soil does at 1 foot deep, allowing plants whose roots are normally 1 foot long to grow with only 1 inch of soil. Folding over the carpet for added depth, or layering multiple carpets atop one another, increases the soil depth to allow for larger plants to grow on the carpet.

The carpet weighs 30 pounds and takes 1 minute to roll the carpet up or out. When rolled up, it has a 1 foot diameter. The carpet can be cut into smaller plots using a magical blade, with each plot being at least 1 foot on a side.
