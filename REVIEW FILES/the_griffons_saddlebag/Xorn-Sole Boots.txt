Xorn-Sole Boots
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This pair of iron-toed boots is made with the rocky leather hide of a xorn. Each boot is secured with three golden buttons bearing the icon of an eye and has several claw-like spikes extending from its toe and heel. While wearing these boots, you can use a bonus action to speak their command word and click the boots' heels together. If you do, you gain tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet and a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

You can use this property for up to 10 minutes, all at once or in several shorter bursts, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. During this time, you can pinpoint the location of precious metals and stones, such as coins and gems, within the range of your tremorsense.

When the boots' property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you finish a long rest.
