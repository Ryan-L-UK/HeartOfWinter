⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Bow of the Spelldrinker
Weapon (any bow), very rare (requires attunement)
___

This gilded bow creates hazy illusions of the cosmos when drawn. Attacks made with this magic bow deal an extra 1d4 force damage to any target hit by it.

When you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you while holding this bow, you can use your reaction to draw from your own life force and attempt to counter it. When you do, you lose 30 hit points and fire a magical arrow of pure force from the bow toward the creature. If the creature is casting a spell of 5th level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. In addition, the target must make a DC 16 saving throw, using its spellcasting modifier. On a failed save, the creature takes 30 force damage as the magic is ripped from them. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much force damage. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.
