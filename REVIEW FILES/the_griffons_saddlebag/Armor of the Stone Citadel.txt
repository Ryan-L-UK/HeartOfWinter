Armor of the Stone Citadel Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)
___

This armor is made of stone and reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than 17, instead of 15. Castle-like crenellations run along the tops of the armor's various pieces. While wearing the armor, you can't be petrified, and you have a damage threshold of 10. In addition, if you are blocking a friendly creature enough to grant it half cover against an attack or hostile effect, that creature instead has three-quarters cover against it.

While in this form, you gain 100 temporary hit points and have an AC of 18, your damage threshold increases to 20, and you can't be moved or knocked prone. You are also immune to any spell or effect that would alter your form. You remain in this form for up to 8 hours, at which point you return to your normal form. You return to your normal form early if you lose all of these temporary hit points or if you end the effect using an action. While in this form, you can't cast spells, and your normal attacks are replaced by unarmed strikes using your massive stone fists. These unarmed strikes have a reach of 30 feet and deal 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. You can make two unarmed strike attacks on each of your turns when you take the Attack action, even if you can normally make more. Alternatively, you can use an action to hurl a boulder from your arm. The boulder is a ranged weapon attack with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. On a hit, it deals 6d8 bludgeoning damage. You are...
