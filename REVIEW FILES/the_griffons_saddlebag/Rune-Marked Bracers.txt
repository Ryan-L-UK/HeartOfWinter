💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Rune-Marked Bracers Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

These bracers were made by giant stone carvers and enchanters. Five elemental runes are carved into the sides of this pair of stone bracers, which magically loosen or tighten around your forearms to fit. Each bracer weighs 10 pounds, but they miraculously become weightless once you attune to them. While wearing the bracers, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

If you're wearing the bracers, you can use your reaction when a creature hits you with a melee attack to activate one of the runes on the bracers. Once a rune has been activated, that rune can't be used again until the next dawn.

𝘾𝙡𝙤𝙪𝙙. The attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 30 feet away from you.

𝙁𝙞𝙧𝙚. The attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 fire damage. The creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute, taking another 1d8 fire damage on a failed save, or ending the effect on a successful one. Alternatively, a creature within reach of the original attacker can use an action to extinguish the flames and end the effect.

𝙁𝙧𝙤𝙨𝙩. The attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 3d8 cold damage and have its speed halved until the end of your next turn.

𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙣𝙚. The attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become sluggish and stone-like, causing the creature to be restrained until the end of your next turn.

𝙎𝙩𝙤𝙧𝙢. The attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d8 lightning damage and it can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.
