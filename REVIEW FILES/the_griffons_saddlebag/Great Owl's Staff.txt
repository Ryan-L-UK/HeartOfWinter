Great Owl's Staff Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
___

While holding this staff, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear.

The staff has 5 charges. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: "darkvision" (2 charges), "enhance ability" (2 charges; "owl's wisdom" only), or "vicious mockery" (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level).

The staff regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes in a puff of downy feathers and is destroyed.
