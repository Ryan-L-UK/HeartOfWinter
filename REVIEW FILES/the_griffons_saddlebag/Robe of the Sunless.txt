💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Robe of the Sunless Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

The folds of this robe are virtually undetectable, as any light that touches it is mysteriously absorbed. Whenever you take radiant damage while wearing this cloak, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 1d10 + 10. If you have the Sunlight Sensitivity trait, you are unaffected by that trait while wearing the robe.

In addition, you can use an action to cast either the "pass without trace" or "unseen servant" spell from the robe while wearing it. The "unseen servant" created by the robe appears as a shadowy figure in dim and bright light, but is invisible in darkness. The servant remains for the duration of the spell or until it's reduced to 0 hit points. If the servant is destroyed, the robe can't be used to cast the spell again until the next dusk. Once the robe is used to cast "pass without trace", it can't do so again until the next dusk. Any spell cast from the robe ends early if you remove the robe.
