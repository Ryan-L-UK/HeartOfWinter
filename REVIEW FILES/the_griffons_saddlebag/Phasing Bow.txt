Phasing Bow
Weapon (any bow), very rare (requires attunement)
___

This flexible bow is made from the chitinous legs of a phase spider and retains some of its ethereal properties. The bow has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you make a ranged attack roll with this magic bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause the arrow to slip partially into the Ethereal Plane. When you do, the target of the attack gains no benefit from cover, including total cover, as long as the cover isn't made of lead or more than 1 foot thick. If you hit, the target takes an extra 2d6 force damage. Any effect that blocks travel through the Ethereal Plane also blocks the arrow.

Alternatively, you can speak the bow's command word as a bonus action to expend 3 of its charges and fire an arrow at a point you can see within the weapon's normal range. When the arrow hits a solid surface, you vanish from your location and reappear in an unoccupied space nearest to that point.
