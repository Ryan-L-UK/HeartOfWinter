Doom Bloom
Wondrous item, rare
___

This dark, velvety lotus has tiny pinpricks of starlight in its petals and releases lofting, magical pollen. Once picked, a "doom bloom" withers and is destroyed after 1d6 + 1 days. As an action, you can inhale the magical pollen from a picked flower and speak the name of a creature or location that's on the same plane of existence as you, duplicating the effect of the "scrying" spell (save DC 15).

If the target of the effect fails the saving throw, the spell succeeds and the flower explodes into a burst of pollen and is destroyed. If the target succeeds on the saving throw, you instead witness hundreds of brief, painful visions until the start of your next turn that show you untold ways that you might die. When the visions end, you take 6d6 psychic damage, but the flower isn't destroyed. Once this property of the flower has been used, it can't be used again for 24 hours.

"Doom blooms" typically grow on their own, but can sometimes be found near others. When the flower dies or is destroyed, a new one grows after 1d6 + 1 days in the same place in which it last grew. If the flower was successfully used to duplicate the effect of the "scrying" spell, the new flower grows at the location where the spell's sensor first appeared instead. If the sensor followed a creature, there is a 10 percent chance that an additional flower will grow after 1d6 + 1 days at the sensor's location at the end of each minute of the spell's duration.
