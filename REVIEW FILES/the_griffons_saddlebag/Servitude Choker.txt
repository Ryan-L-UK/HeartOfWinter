💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Servitude Choker
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This necklace can animate small, nonliving items and have them fulfill simple tasks for you. As an action, you can drape or wrap the necklace around a Small or smaller nonmagical object that weighs less than fifty pounds, isn't attached to a surface or anything else, and isn't being carried by another creature. The adorned object springs to life, sprouting little arms and legs, and becomes a mindless creature under your control until you remove the necklace or it takes damage. The servant has an AC of 10 and a movement speed of 20 feet.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can mentally command the servant if it is within 60 feet of you. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. The servant can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds. Once you give it a command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command. If you command the servant to perform a task that would put it in danger or move it more than 60 feet away from you, the servant does nothing.

The necklace can animate an object for up to 8 hours or until it takes damage. When the effects end, the necklace cannot be used again in this way for 1d8 hours.
