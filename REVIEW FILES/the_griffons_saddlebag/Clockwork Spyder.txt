💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Clockwork Spyder Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This brass mechanical spider can fold its legs inward, allowing it to be worn as a brooch, hair pin, or similar. While being worn in this way, the spider appears as a normal pin. You can use a bonus action to speak the spider's command word followed by a single word instruction, such as "unlock" or "disarm." The spider then springs to life and carries out the task to the best of its ability, using its numerous legs as thieves' tools. The spider has a +7 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks, as well as any ability check it makes using thieves' tools. The spider can remain animated for up to 10 minutes. Each time it's given a new spoken command, it uses a minimum of 1 minute from the duration.

The tripwire is nearly invisible, requiring a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher to notice it, and it gives no resistance when broken. While you're within 1,000 feet of a tripwire created in this way, you are magically made aware of it when it's broken, such as if a creature walks through it. When this happens, you only know which wire is broken, but not what caused it to break. You can have up to three tripwires at a time, which remain for up to 8 hours. Creating a fourth tripwire causes the first one to break.

You can mentally deactivate the spider early using a bonus action. The...
