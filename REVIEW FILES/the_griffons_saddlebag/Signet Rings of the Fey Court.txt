Signet Rings of the Fey Court
Ring, very rare (requires attunement by an elf, half-elf, or other fey creature)
___

This set of wooden rings once belonged to a powerful fey creature who ruled over a domain on their native plane of existence. You must be wearing all four rings in order to attune to and use their magic. While wearing the rings, you know the druidcraft cantrip. In addition, you gain the elf's Trance racial feature if you don't already have it.

𝙎𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙤𝙣'𝙨 𝙍𝙚𝙨𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙚. Each of the four rings has a corresponding season: autumn, spring, summer, or winter. Each ring contains 2 charges and regains all expended charges each day at dawn. You can expend 1 of a particular ring's charges as a reaction when you take damage of a type corresponding to that ring in order to gain resistance to that type until the start of your next turn, including against the triggering attack: autumn (necrotic damage resistance), spring (radiant damage resistance), summer (fire damage resistance), or winter (cold damage resistance).

𝙈𝙖𝙜𝙞𝙘 𝙍𝙚𝙨𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙚. Alternatively, you can expend any 2 charges from the rings as a reaction when you're affected by a hostile spell or other magical effect in order to gain advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects until the start of your next turn instead.
Once a ring has no remaining charges, the small landscape adorning the top of it withers until it regains charges the following dawn.
