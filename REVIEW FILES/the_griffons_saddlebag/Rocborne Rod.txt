Rocborne Rod
Rod, rare (requires attunement)
___

This wooden rod is carved in the representation of five ancient rocs. Motes of their spirit flow through it and allow you to channel some of their lingering power.

This rod has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the rod, you can use a reaction while falling or an action otherwise to expend 1 of its charge to cause two handles extend from both ends. While holding the handles, a pair of magical wings appear above the rod that reduce your falling speed to 10 feet per round, or 20 feet if you weigh more than 200 pounds. While falling in this way, you gain a flying speed of 40 feet but cannot fly upwards without a significant updraft. If you land on the ground while falling in this way, you take no damage from falling.

In addition, you can use the rod to summon a buffeting gust of wind around you. While holding the rod aloft, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges. When you do, powerful winds whip around you and blow everything within 20 feet of you skyward in a column of wind 60 feet high. Large and smaller creatures within range must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be launched 30 feet upward before crashing back to the ground. Affected objects weighing less than 200 pounds are also launched by the wind. You automatically succeed on the saving throw unless you decide to fail it. If you choose to fail the saving throw and use your reaction to summon the magical wings (if they weren't already summoned), you're carried upward 60 feet instead.
