💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Wand of Whispers
Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
___

These wands are sometimes found in the hands of clandestine mages posing as simple townsfolk. Its magic wax and iron design resembles a candle and candlestick. The wand produces a harmless, magical flame that is indistinguishable from normal candlelight, although the wax never melts or changes shape. The flame is harmless and casts bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for another 5 feet. While holding the wand, you can extinguish or relight the flame as a bonus action.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast either the "message" (no charges) or "sending" spell (3 charges) from it. Alternatively, when you cast a spell of 5th level or lower while holding the wand, you can expend 1 of the wand's charges per spell slot level to ignore the spell's verbal components. Any spell that requires a target to hear its verbal component gains no benefit from this property.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the magical flame burns out and the wand becomes a mundane candle and candlestick.
