Companion's Band
Wondrous item, common (requires attunement)
___

This woven band can be worn as a necklace or bracelet by resizing the strap. While attuned to and wearing the band, you can use an action to summon a spectral companion that appears in a space within 5 feet of you. The companion can be a dog, cat, bird, or similar Small or smaller beast. The form is translucent and immaterial, but feels warm to the touch. It emits dim light in a 5 foot radius. The companion remains until dismissed (no action required) or until you remove the band. It is not considered to be a creature, does not occupy a space, and does not require food, water, or air. It is friendly towards you and other creatures of your choice and stays within 30 feet of you at all times, moving through objects as necessary in order to do so. The companion wears a spectral copy of the band on its neck or leg when you summon it (your choice). The companion understands the emotion and intent of your commands, but cannot speak. Attempting to target the companion with a ”detect thoughts” spell only reveals an overwhelming sense of love and affection towards you.

Once the same spectral companion has remained or has been summoned at least once a day for 7 consecutive days, the band becomes attuned to you instead. When it does, the band no longer requires you to attune to it in order to use the item, and no creature other than you can use its magic without first attuning to it themselves. When another creature attunes to the band in this way, its connection to you is broken. Once the band is attuned to you in this way, you can summon the companion using a bonus action instead of an action, but can no longer change its form when summoning it. In addition, once the band is attuned to you, the companion becomes partially physical, allowing you and creatures of your choice to gently pet and hold its otherwise spectral form.
