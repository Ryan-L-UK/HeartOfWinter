💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Contact Lenses Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

These small glass lenses fit comfortably over your eyes, becoming invisible while worn. While you're wearing them, you can use a bonus action to alter the appearance of your eyes. The change remains until you use another bonus action to change them again or remove the lenses. When you make a Wisdom (Perception) check that relies on sight while wearing the lenses, your bonus to the roll can't be negative.

In addition, while maintaining eye contact with a creature within 120 feet of you, both you and that creature can speak telepathically with each other. To understand each other, you each must speak mentally in a language you share.
