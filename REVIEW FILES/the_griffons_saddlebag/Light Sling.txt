Light Sling
Weapon (sling), common
___

As an action, you can speak this magic sling's command word and hurl a tiny ball of light at a point or target you can see within 30 feet of you. The ball of light sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. On a hit, the ball deals no damage and sticks to the target for up to 1 minute, until the sling is used to hurl another ball of light, or until a creature within reach of the light uses its action to snuff it out (as if snuffing out a candle). If the target is an unwilling creature or an object being worn or carried by one, the creature must also make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the ball sticks to the target for the duration. On a successful save, the ball of light winks out.
