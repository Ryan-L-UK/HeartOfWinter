💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Bandolier of the Elements
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This cross-chest bandolier has 6 magic daggers sheathed across it. When you take the Attack action while wearing this bandolier, you can use a bonus action to throw 1 of the daggers, making a ranged attack with it, provided you have a free hand. When you hit a target with one of these daggers, roll a d6 and consult the table below. The target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the type determined by the table, in addition to the weapon's damage, and the dagger disappears. On a miss, the dagger vanishes and reappears in the bandolier.

A dagger vanishes if you don’t hurl it right away and immediately reappears in the bandolier. 1d6 missing daggers reappear in the bandolier's empty sheaths daily at dawn.
