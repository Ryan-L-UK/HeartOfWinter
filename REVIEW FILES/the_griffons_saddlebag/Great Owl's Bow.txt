Great Owl's Bow Weapon (any bow), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

Arrows fired from this magic bow between dusk and dawn are silent while in flight. The bow has 5 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack using the bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause the arrow to split into a spray of magical feathers. Each other creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 + 3 force damage.
