💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Ear Cuff of the Vampire Bat
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

While wearing this dark ceramic ear cuff, your Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing are made with advantage. In addition, whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check that involves hearing, you can choose to command the ear cuff to momentarily enhance your senses. When you do, its eyes flash with a piercing red glow as the bat's ceramic fangs bite down on your ear. You take 1d4+1 necrotic damage from its bite, and immediately gain a bonus to your Wisdom (Perception) check equal to the amount of necrotic damage taken in this way. This damage ignores any resistance or immunity to necrotic damage. You can decide to use this ability after you roll the d20, but before the DM determines the outcome.
