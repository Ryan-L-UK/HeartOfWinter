Caduceus Flail
Weapon (flail), rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)
___

This holy flail serves as a conduit for divine warriors and pulses with holy light, allowing you to fend off evil while protecting the wounded. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding the flail, you can use a bonus action to speak the weapon's command word to cause it to to glow, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The light lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the flail. When you hit an undead with the glowing flail, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

When you use your Channel Divinity while holding the glowing flail, hostile creatures in the weapon's bright light take radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier, and friendly creatures in the bright light regain hit points equal to the same amount. This damage is dealt before any other effects from your Channel Divinity. In addition, if your Channel Divinity forces a creature to make a saving throw, any undead in the flail's bright light that fail the saving throw are also blinded until the end of your next turn.
