Lightsplitter Javelin
Weapon (javelin), uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This dark crystal javelin has a prismatic head that can refract light into beautiful displays of color. Immediately after you throw this javelin and it hits a target within 120 feet of you, the javelin disappears in a small burst of light before reappearing in your open hand.

As an action, you can throw the javelin at a point within 120 feet and speak its command word. When the javelin lands, it erupts in a dazzling display of color and light, casting painful bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet. Creatures of your choice within the bright light must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. For each creature hit by the light, roll a d6 to determine the color of light that hits it and type of damage that it takes using the table below. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 2d10 damage for each beam of light that hits it of the type determined by the table. Once this property of the javelin has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn.

d6 | Color | Damage type
-
1 | Red | Fire
-
2 | Orange | Acid
-
3 | Yellow | Lightning
-
4 | Green | Poison
-
5 | Blue | Cold
-
6 | Special | The creature is struck by two beams of light. Roll twice more, rerolling any 6.
