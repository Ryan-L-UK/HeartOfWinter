Vial Ring Ring, common
___

This ring is made of glass and has a cork stopper at its top like a set gemstone. You can unstopper the ring (no action required) to magically transform it into a small glass vial. The vial holds up to 1 ounce of liquid. The mouth of the vial and ring are both a half inch wide, allowing the cork to remain the same size even when the ring is transformed. When the vial is stoppered, it magically returns to its ring form. Anything contained by the vial magically fits within the ring while it's transformed.

While the ring itself is magical, the cork is not. Any cork of the right size can be used to stopper the ring or vial, allowing you to mark the corks as needed or replace them, should they become lost or destroyed by acid or other similar hazardous (albeit bottleable) materials.
