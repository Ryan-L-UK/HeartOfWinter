💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Quicksilver Clay
Wondrous item, common
___

This small orb of silver, watery liquid is strangely dry to the touch. While holding the 1-inch diameter metallic sphere in the palm of your hand, you can mentally control the form that it takes as an action. The form stretches and turns into imagined shape no larger than the palm of your hand and remains centered there. The form returns to its natural orb state when you end your focus on the quicksilver clay (no action required) or it leaves your hand. Regardless of the form it takes, it is still a liquid.

Eating or drinking the liquid is harmless, but takes 1d4 days to exit the body.
