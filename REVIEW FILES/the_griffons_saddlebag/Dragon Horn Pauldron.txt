Dragon Horn Pauldron
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

This single pauldron is made from the horn of a fallen dragon. While wearing it, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and have resistance to one damage type, which is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the horn, as shown on the table below.

Dragon | Resistance
—
Black | Acid
Blue | Lightning
Brass | Fire
Bronze | Lightning
Copper | Acid
Gold | Fire
Green | Fire
Red | Fire
Silver | Cold
White | Cold

In addition, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage of this resisted type, you can use your reaction to instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw.
