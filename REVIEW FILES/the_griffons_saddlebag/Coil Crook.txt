⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Coil Crook
Staff, uncommon
___

This red, smooth staff is actually made of a rigid length of rope. You can speak the staff's command word as a bonus action to cause it to magically loosen and turn into 10 feet of decorative silken rope. You can speak the command word again as a bonus action to cause the rope to untangle itself and form the solid staff again. It can be used as a spellcasting focus in either of these forms.

You can use the staff to cast the "rope trick" spell using it as the rope required for the spell. Once this staff has been used to cast this spell, it can't be used to cast the spell again until the following dawn.
