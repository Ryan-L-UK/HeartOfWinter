Shadowshawl
Wondrous item, rare
___

This light gray shawl is made of opaque fabric that looks like the woven web of a spider. While you wear this shawl with its hood up, your face is hidden within a small pocket of magical darkness. You can see through this magical darkness from beneath the hood as if it were nonmagical darkness. If you have the Sunlight Sensitivity trait, you are unaffected by the trait. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
