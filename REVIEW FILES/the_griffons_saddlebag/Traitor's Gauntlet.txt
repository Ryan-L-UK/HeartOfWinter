💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Traitor's Gauntlet
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This pair of gloves is matched with one dark metal gauntlet, which once belonged to a traitorous knight who was burned for his treason. While wearing these gloves and gauntlet, your unarmed strikes with your hands are turned into magic weapons that deal 1d8 necrotic damage.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to speak the gauntlet's command word while holding a nonmagical melee weapon in the hand that's wearing it. When you do, the weapon becomes magical while you hold it in that hand. The weapon ceases to be magical if you throw, drop, or stow it. While the weapon is magical in this way, it's wreathed in dark flames that cause any target hit by it to take necrotic damage, instead of the weapon's normal damage, as well as an extra 1d8 fire damage.

While unworn, the gauntlet can be magically altered to fit over either hand by speaking its other command word as an action.

𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚. This gauntlet is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the gauntlet, keeping it within reach at all times, and you can't remove the gloves. In addition, while you're cursed, you gain the following flaw: "Everyone has an ulterior motive, so I can only count on myself." While you have this flaw, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with friendly creatures, and you can't take the Help action.
