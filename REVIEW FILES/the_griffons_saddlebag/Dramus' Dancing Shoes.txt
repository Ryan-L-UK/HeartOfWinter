Dramus' Dancing Shoes
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by bard)
___

These comfortable wine dark slippers give confidence in your dancing abilities. Even if you aren't attuned to the shoes, you have advantage on any Charisma (Performance) checks to dance while wearing them. If you are attuned to the shoes while wearing them, you can cause musical notes to play from them whenever you take a step, as if they were instruments, allowing you to use your feet as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. Charisma (Performance) checks made to dance in this way are made separately from Charisma (Performance) checks made to play music.
