Candy Xorn
Wondrous item, common
___

"Candy xorn" is a round, waxy candy that typically comes in small bags of 2d6 + 3 pieces. Each piece is traditionally either orange or yellow, but always has a narrow, reptilian pupil drawn at its center. Eating a "candy xorn" causes your eyes to turn orange or yellow (your choice), and your pupils to match the ones found on the piece of candy. After 1 minute, the effect ends and your eyes return to normal.

In addition, each piece of “candy xorn“ has a 5 percent chance to not be candy at all, but actually a gemstone covered in the sugared coating. When you find a gemstone in this way, it can be either eye agate (40%, 10 gp), tiger's eye (40%, 10 gp), or amber (20%, 100 gp).
