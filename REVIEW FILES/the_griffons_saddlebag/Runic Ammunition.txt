Runic Ammunition
Weapon (a bolt, arrow, or piece of sling ammunition), rare
___

Runic ammunition resembles normal bolts, arrows, or stones that are etched with runes and are magically discordant to spellcasters. Creatures concentrating on a spell when they're hit by a piece of runic ammunition make the resulting Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration with disadvantage.

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.
