💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Clockwork Healerbee
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

This pill-shaped magical mechanism is 2 inches long and made of brass. It has a pair of tiny wings that silently keep it aloft. It hovers up to 5 feet above the ground and does its best to stay at your side within your space. The bee can enter and pass through another creature's space and does not provoke opportunity attacks.

The bee has 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While the bee is within your space, you can speak its command word and expend up to 3 of its charges as a bonus action to command the bee to heal a creature that you can see within 20 feet of you. The bee flies to the creature's space and touches its stinger to the creature, emitting a bright light that fills the bee's space and healing the creature for 1d6 hit points for each expended charge. After healing the creature, the bee returns to your space.

The bee is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has AC 15, 10 hit points, and has resistance to all damage types. If the "mending" spell is cast on the bee while it has at least 1 hit point, it regains 2d6 hit points. If the bee drops to 0 hit points, it can't be used again for 24 hours, at which point it regains all its hit points.
