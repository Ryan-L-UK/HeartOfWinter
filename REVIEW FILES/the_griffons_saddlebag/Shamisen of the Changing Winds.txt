Shamisen of the Changing Winds Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard)
___

This shamisen has a tiny cherry tree growing along its base. When played, the tree's leaves rustle in a magical breeze. You must be proficient with a string instrument to use this shamisen.

You can use an action to play the instrument and release a flurry of cutting wind from it. When you do, you can choose to make a ranged spell attack against a target you can see within 60 feet of you, using your spell attack bonus, as part of that action. On a hit, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier.

When you score a critical hit with a ranged attack using the shamisen, make a Charisma (Performance) check using the instrument. If the total of the roll exceeds the target's AC, the target is incapacitated until the end of your next turn, as it's transfixed by the music. A deafened creature or creature that can't hear is immune to this effect.

Whenever you expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration, you can magically change the instrument's tuning. Whenever you use an action to play the instrument, you also gain a benefit associated with its tuning, which lasts until the end of your next turn. Alternatively, you can spend 1 minute to retune the instrument. When found, the instrument is set to a random tuning.

• 𝙃𝙤𝙣𝙘𝙝𝙤𝙨𝙝𝙞. While set to this tuning, the summoned wind swirls around you in a protective breeze, granting you a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks.

• 𝙉𝙞 𝘼𝙜𝙖𝙧𝙞. While set to this tuning, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

• 𝙎𝙖𝙣 𝙎𝙖𝙜𝙖𝙧𝙞. While set to this tuning, your spell attacks with the shamisen score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

Alternatively, you can spend at least 1 minute playing the instrument. When you do, the air around you in a 40-foot radius grows still. The atmosphere within that area becomes comfortable and dry (regardless of the weather), and any creature that isn't deafened and can hear the instrument that starts its turn within the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your bard spell save DC. On a failed save...
