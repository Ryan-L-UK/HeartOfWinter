⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Bullseye Dart Weapon (dart), rare
___

The weighted end of this dart is made to resemble a stylized eye, and its shaft is hewn from a bull's horn. Your attacks with this magic weapon score a critical hit on a roll of 16–20. Once this happens, the dart loses this property for 1 minute. In the meantime, it can still be used as a magic dart.
