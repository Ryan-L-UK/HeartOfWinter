Purse Piglet 
Wondrous item, rare
___

This ceramic piglet figurine is glazed with a friendly pink coating that's soft to the touch and has a hole in the top that's stoppered with a cork. When you drop a coin in the piglet and stopper it again, the figurine springs to life. If you place a coin inside it to animate the pig, it imprints on you and considers you its owner. The owner can hold and gently shake the piglet, causing it to oink happily, and know how much money is inside of it.

Once alive, the piglet will happily eat any coin handed to it, storing it inside, and will spit out exact change when you ask it - even converting them into larger or smaller denominations. The figurine can hold only coins and will spit or sneeze out anything else you place inside of it. The piglet squeals with glee and prances about excitedly when you deposit or feed it coins. The pig can eat up to 1000 coins of any denomination every hour it spends eating them. It will eat electrum pieces with less enthusiasm. It remains the same size regardless of how many coins are inside of it.

The piglet is exceptionally loyal and will listen to commands issued by the owner and other allied creatures of the owner's choosing. It walks beside you or the nearest ally as best it can, but vanishes into a pocket dimension if it is ever more than 30 feet away from them. The figurine can be summoned to you or an allied creature's location at any time using the command phrase "Come home, little piggy" as a bonus action. You can tell the figurine to return to its pocket dimension using another bonus action with the command phrase "Go to market, little piggy." When asking for 10% or more of its total stockpile, the piglet looks disappointed before carrying out the request. The piglet can eject its own stopper and roll over on its back to empty itself of coins when asked for a large amount, but will always retain at least one copper coin unless physically removed. The figurine returns its inanimate form when empty.

The piglet has 5 hit points, an AC of 10, and a walking speed of 30 feet. It does not need air to breathe. If the piglet is slain, it cries out and shatters into...
