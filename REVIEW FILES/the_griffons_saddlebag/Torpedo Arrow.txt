⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Torpedo Arrow
Weapon (arrow), common
___

This unique arrow's spiral design allows it to travel nearly unimpaired in the water. When firing this type of munition underwater, you ignore the normal disadvantages of underwater fighting. When you fire this weapon out of water, the normal and long range of the ammunition is halved.
