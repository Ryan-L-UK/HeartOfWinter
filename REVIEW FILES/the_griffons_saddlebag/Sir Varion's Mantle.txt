💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Sir Varion's Mantle
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This sturdy, waterproof riding cape once belonged to Sir Varion, a famed knight known for his charm and eccentricity. While wearing this cape, you can spend 10 minutes to cast the "find steed" spell from it. When you do, the summoned steed is in the form of a giant toad. The steed remains for the duration or until your attunement to the mantle ends. When the steed drops to 0 hit points, this property can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

In addition, while you're mounted, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks.
