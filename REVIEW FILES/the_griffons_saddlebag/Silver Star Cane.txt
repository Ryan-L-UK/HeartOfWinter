Silver Star Cane
Weapon (rapier), common
___

This magic rapier is indistinguishable from a cane while stowed in its leather-wrapped wooden sheath. You can press a button on top of the cane to extend its handle upward (no action required), revealing a more comfortable grip with which to wield it. The rapier is adorned with eight pearls in the form of a heavenly constellation. When you draw the weapon, the pearls shed bright light in a line 5 feet long and 1 inch wide until the end of your turn. The line always points north.
