💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Pollinator Pants
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)
___

While wearing this pair of black-and-yellow striped pants, any flower you move within 5 feet of magically blossoms, as if by the "druidcraft" spell.

The pants have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the pants, you can use an action to expend 1 of their charges to cast the "speak with plants" spell from them. This version of the spell only affects plants within the spell's range that have at least one flower on them. When you speak with a plant in this way, you do so by making a combination of somatic gestures and dance-like steps, rather than using your voice. These movements come naturally to you for the duration of the spell and magically convey your message.

𝘽𝙚𝙚𝙠𝙚𝙚𝙥𝙚𝙧'𝙨 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙢𝙞𝙩𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩. While you are attuned to three magic items that have this named property, the pants regain all expended charges daily at dawn, instead of 1d3, and gain the following benefit:

𝙎𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜. When you take the Attack action on each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to make a special unarmed strike against a creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d4 piercing damage from the attack. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this unarmed strike, the target takes an extra 10 poison damage from the attack and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of your next turn.
