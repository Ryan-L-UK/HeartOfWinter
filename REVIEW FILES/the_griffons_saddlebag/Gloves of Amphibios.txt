Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

These gloves come in many different colors and meld seamlessly into your hands when you don them. While wearing these gloves, climbing doesn't cost you extra movement, you gain a +1 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to grapple a creature, and any creature grappled by you that is not wearing armor takes 1d4 poison damage at the end of each of your turns.
