💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Hydra Charm
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

This golden talisman is made of five twisting hydra heads and hung from a simple gold chain. While wearing this talisman, you gain the following benefits:
.
• When you use your reaction to make an opportunity attack, you can make a second attack against that same target as part of that reaction.
.
• You can make an opportunity attack, even if you've already used your reaction.
.
• When you are forced to make a saving throw against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or incapacitated, you can use your reaction to make the saving throw with advantage.
.
• When you take more than 25 damage from a single attack or effect, you can use your reaction to regain 10 hit points. If this damage would reduce you to 0 hit points but not kill you outright, you remain at 1 hit point instead and do not regain 10 hit points.
.
• When your head would be cut off by an effect, such as by a "vorpal sword", you can use your reaction to negate the effect.

Once a benefit of the talisman has been used, that benefit can't be used again until you finish a long rest.
