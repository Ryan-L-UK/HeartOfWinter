Myceliaweave Armor
Armor (leather, studded leather, or hide), rare (requires attunement)
___

This naturally-sourced armor is interwoven with fibers and caps from a resilient strain of violet fungus that grows when exposed to rejuvenating magic. While wearing this armor, your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, and whenever a spell or magical effect causes you to regain hit points, you also gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the number of hit points you recover, up to a maximum of 15 temporary hit points. While you have temporary hit points in this way, you also have resistance to necrotic damage.

𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚. Once you don and attune to this magic armor, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the remove curse spell or you die: a side effect of the violet fungus' magical and parasitic effects. When your attunement to the armor ends, your Constitution score is reduced by 2 (to a minimum score of 1) until 2d6 + 6 days have passed or until you attune to the armor again.
