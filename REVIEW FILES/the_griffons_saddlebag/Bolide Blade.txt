Bolide Blade Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)
___

This black blade was forged from the metal of a meteor. When swung, a cosmic plume of shooting stars and distant galaxies can be seen in its dark afterimage. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which also has the finesse property.

𝘾𝙤𝙨𝙢𝙞𝙘 𝘿𝙞𝙡𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. Each day at dusk, you gain the benefits of the "mirror image" spell. This version of the spell only has two duplicates, instead of three, and remains until both duplicates are destroyed or until the blade isn't on your person.

𝙎𝙩𝙖𝙧𝙨𝙝𝙤𝙬𝙚𝙧 𝙎𝙖𝙮𝙖. As an action, you can sheath the blade immediately before making a special attack with it. Choose an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you that's also within 5 feet of another creature that you can see. You then draw the blade and shoot forward in a streak of light, harmlessly passing through any creature between you and the space. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. When you arrive at the new space, make an attack roll with advantage using the sword against a creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes an extra 4d12 radiant damage and releases seven motes of starlight from it, or four on a miss. The motes of starlight are "magic missiles", which can each target the same or different targets of your choice within 60 feet of the target of the attack. Hit or miss, you then regain the effects of the "mirror image" from the weapon's Cosmic Dilation. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.
