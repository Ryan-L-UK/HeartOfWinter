Galea of the Soulfire Phoenix
Wondrous Item, artifact (requires attunement)
___

This magical helmet once belonged to the Soulfire Phoenix Fara, a paragon to the citizens of the Elemental Plane of Fire who led her people to victory during the Savrayan Wars. While some believe that her ferocity and heroism were a result of phoenix blood running through her veins, others claim that a hero will always rise from the ashes when the time is right.

A spark of this heroism resides within the helmet, imparting its passion and phoenix-like properties to you. You have resistance to fire damage while wearing the helmet. While you're in combat, magical flames spew from the helmet while you wear it. The fire is harmless and casts bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

In addition, you and friendly creatures within the bright light regain consciousness on a roll of 19 or 20 on death saving throws.

When you do, you also sprout a pair of flaming wings that last for the duration of the spell and give you a flying speed of 30 feet. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

While wearing the helmet, you can expend 1 or more charges from it to cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components to do so (save DC 18): "death ward" (3 charges), "flame strike" (4 charges), or "healing word" (2nd-level version, 1 charge; +5 spellcasting ability modifier). ...Continued in the comments!
