Prized Pet Protector Wondrous item, uncommon or rare
___

A typical "prized pet protector", an uncommon item, is a colorful bandana featuring swirling paisleys and various pet-themed designs. You can tie this bandana around the neck of a willing beast with a challenge rating of 1 or lower using an action. The bandana changes size to comfortably fit around the creature's neck and can't be removed against its will. When the beast is reduced to 0 hit points while wearing the bandana, but not killed outright, the creature is harmlessly shunted to a special demiplane. The creature reappears after 8 hours in an empty space within 10 feet of you with all its hit points. The bandana's magic then ceases to function until 2 days have passed.

The following "prized pet protector" is a rare variant with additional properties. It's made of fine silk, and its designs are embroidered with golden thread. A beast that wears it also gains a +2 bonus to saving throws.

If the beast wearing the bandana is a transformed humanoid or other creature, such as by the "polymorph" spell or similar magic, the bandana has no effect on it. The bandana can be worn over a collar.
