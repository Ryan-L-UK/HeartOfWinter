Dream Catcher Weapon (net), very rare
___

This circular net is stylized with large white feathers around its edge. Unlike a normal net, the "dream catcher" can restrain a formless creature such as a ghost or water elemental. The net is immune to slashing damage, and it requires a DC 16 Strength check, instead of DC 10, to free a creature from the net.

The net has 8 charges, which are represented by the number of feathers around the net. When you throw the net, you can speak its command word to expend up to 4 of its charges. If the net hits and restrains a creature, that creature is also affected by the "sleep" spell. The spell targets only the creature within the net, and its spell level is equal to the number of charges expended from the net when it was thrown. If a creature falls unconscious as a result of this effect, it can't be woken up early until the net is removed.

When you expend a charge, one of the feathers disappears in a dream-like cloud of smoke. The net regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn.
