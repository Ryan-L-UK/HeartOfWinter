Fool's Lamp
Wondrous item, very rare
___

This brass lamp is decorated with flowing patterns around a blue, glass chamber at its center. Swirling, magenta clouds drift within the lamp and billow eagerly whenever it's held. Created as a grim sculpture by a spiteful djinni, this lamp offers no benefit to those foolish enough to encounter it.

An "identify" or "legend lore" spell correctly reveals the lamp to be empty, as well as its true nature. However, identifying the lamp by any other means will reveal that the lamp has a djinni trapped inside it, allowing it to function as a "ring of djinni summoning" while held and without requiring attunement. It also reveals that the only way to summon the djinni is to ask it for a wish (such as a "wish" spell or general command), treating the wish as a command phrase.

When a creature holding the lamp speaks such a phrase using an action, the GM uses the table below to choose the outcome or determine it randomly:

| d10 | Effect |
—
| 1 | You're shunted to a harmless demiplane inside the lamp for 1 hour, during which time you can see as if you were in the lamp's space, but are otherwise incapacitated and deafened. At the end of each of your turns while you're in the demiplane, you can make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, ending the effect early on a success. At the end of the duration, you return to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of the lamp.
| 2 | A *fireball* (5th-level version, save DC 16) erupts, centered on you.
| 3 | You're unintelligible for 2d6 hours, during which time you only speak in nonsensical sounds.
| 4 | You're under the effect of the *faerie fire* spell for 24 hours.
| 5 | A hostile air (40%), earth (20%), fire (20%), or water (20%) elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.
| 6 | Your legs become unstable for 1d6 hours, during which time you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws, and if you move your full speed on a turn, you must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity check or fall prone.
| 7 | You're affected by the *levitate* spell for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns...
