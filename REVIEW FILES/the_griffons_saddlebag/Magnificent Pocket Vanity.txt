Magnificent Pocket Vanity
Wondrous item, common
___

This palm-sized brass device contains enough magical makeup for 3 uses. A creature holding the vanity can use an action to expend 1 of its uses to apply the makeup to itself or another willing creature within reach, at which point the creature's appearance magically changes to one of the following forms, as if by the "disguise self" spell (save DC 13). This version of the spell can visually alter a creature's height by up to 5 feet, although the creature's size does not change, and you roll on the table below to determine which random appearance the creature assumes:

| d6 | Random Appearance| |  1   | A hunched-over elderly gnomish woman with graying hair, missing teeth, and wearing a ragged, faded dress. | |  2   | An intimidating half-orc man with deep green skin, black hair pulled back in a bun, and battle-worn hide armor. | |  3   | A regal and androgynous elf with a tan complexion and golden hair wearing fine leathers and a shimmering cape of red and silver. | |  4   | A dust-covered human boy of no more than 13 years with messy blonde hair wearing a flimsy cap and half-torn overalls. | |  5   | A strikingly red tiefling woman with white hair wearing silver plate armor and wielding a polished longsword. | |  6   | A bald, dwarven man with a peg leg and scar-covered face wearing the garb of a well-traveled sailor. |

When the last use of the makeup has been used, the vanity and its makeup become nonmagical.
