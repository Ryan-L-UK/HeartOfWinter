⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Couatl Herald's Lash
Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)
___

This slender whip's grip is feathered and comfortable to wield. Its weight has been magically reduced and gently sways on its own. This weapon has the light property. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you take the Attack action and use this whip to make an attack against a Medium or smaller target, you can choose forgo the attack and force the target to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw instead. On a failure, the target is grappled by the whip and takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage as it's constricted by the whip. If you replace another attack with the whip in this way against a target who's already grappled by it, that target becomes restrained by the whip instead upon failing the saving throw.

A target grappled or restrained by the whip can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice). On a success, it is no longer grappled or restrained by the whip.

Until this grapple or restraint ends, you can't use the whip against a different target. Moving more than 10 feet away from the target ends the grapple or restraint.

𝙁𝙡𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝘾𝙤𝙪𝙖𝙩𝙡𝙨. While you're attuned to 3 items with this feature, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. If you already have a flying speed, this speed is in addition to your existing flying speed.
