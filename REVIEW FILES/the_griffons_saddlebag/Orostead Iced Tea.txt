Orostead Iced Tea
Potion, common or very rare
___

The typical "Orostead iced tea", a common potion, is a specialty alcoholic beverage that creates harmless sensory effects with each sip. When made, a tea has enough for 6 + 1d4 sips before it's used up, instead of a single use. You can take a sip as an action. When you drink this potion, roll on the table below to determine which one of the following effects occur:

d8 | Common Effect
1 | You suddenly become drenched with illusory salt water. After 1 minute, it dries.
2 | You're suddenly overwhelmingly warm (50%) or cold (50%) for 1 minute.
3 | You remain frozen in place for 1 second, as if briefly removed from time.
4 | You gain the effect of the "speak with animals" spell for 1 minute.
5 | You suddenly teleport 5 feet into an unoccupied space next to you.
6 | Any clothing you wear becomes various shades of gray for 1 minute.
7 | Static charge builds up on you. Touching or being touched by anything for the next minute causes a sharp shock of electricity to leap between you.
8 | Your skin, hair, and eye colors are inverted. In addition, roll a d12. You grow or shrink a number of inches equal to the result of the die, shrinking by odd numbers or growing by even ones. After 1 minute, your appearance returns to normal.

The drink is incredibly refreshing with notes of lemon, tea, and cherry, and has virtually no alcoholic bite to it. Regardless, due to its magical nature, the alcohol within this potion affects a creature twice as much as the alcohol within a nonmagical beverage.
