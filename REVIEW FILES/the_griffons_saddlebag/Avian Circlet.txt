💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Avian Circlet
Wondrous item, rare
___

This silver, ornate tiara grants you power over certain flying creatures. You can use an action to channel the natural magics that reside within the crown and cast "animal messenger" or "speak with animals" at will. Any creature spoken to or affected by "animal messenger" must be a beast and have a flying speed.

In addition, you can touch a willing beast with a flying speed. For 1 minute, you can see through the creature's eyes, sharing any of its special visual senses for the duration. You are blinded to your own surroundings while you share its vision in this way. You can end this effect early using an action to return to your normal senses. The circlet can't be used in this way until the next dawn.
