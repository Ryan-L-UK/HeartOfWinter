Hoarder's Haul
Wondrous item, rarity varies
___

This magical cart is made from the large, hollow horn of a fallen dragon. While all "hoarder's hauls" are made from the horns of dragons, their true magic stems from the strength of the dragon's greed. Uncommon and rare carts have handles and a single wheel at their front and must be physically moved. Very rare versions have a flying speed of 10 feet, can hover up to 20 feet off the ground, and move according to your spoken directions, provided that you are within 30 feet of the cart.

The cart has two command words. The first command word can be spoken using an action and causes the cart to shrink or enlarge, becoming as small as 1 foot long and 7 inches across or as large as 5 feet long and 3 feet across. Regardless of its size, the cart always weighs 5 pounds without anything inside it. Anything contained by the cart does not resize to fit its new size, potentially spilling onto the ground if the cart becomes too small.

When you place a nonliving object in the cart, you can speak the cart's second command word as an action to cause the object to become locked in place. A locked object can't be removed or interacted with against your will, unless the cart becomes too small to contain it. A creature that attempts to remove an object locked in this way must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the cart for 1 minute. A frightened creature is unwilling to move toward the cart or interact with it for the duration. If the cart is a rare or very rare version, the creature also takes psychic damage on a failed saving throw. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours. You can speak the second command word as an action again to unlock any number of objects within the cart.

The cart's properties depend on the item's rarity, as shown in the table below:

Rarity | Capacity | Save DC | Psychic Damage
-
Uncommon | 250 lb. | 13 | —
-
Rare | 500 lb. | 15 | 3d6
-
Very Rare | 750 lb. | 16 | 6d6
