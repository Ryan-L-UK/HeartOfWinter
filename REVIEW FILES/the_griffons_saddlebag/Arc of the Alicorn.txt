⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Arc of the Alicorn
Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)
___

This magic, ivory bow is sculpted to look like a pair of curved unicorn horns, and is strung with the finely braided hair of a pegasus' mane. This bow's damage die is a d10, instead of a d8.

The bow has 4 charges for the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

𝙁𝙡𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩. While holding the bow, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to cause small wings to appear on your feet that last until the end of your turn. For the duration, you have a flying speed of 90 feet. While the wings remain, you can choose to expend another charge from the bow at the end of each of your turns (no action required) to extend the wings' duration until the end of your next turn.

𝙃𝙚𝙖𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙃𝙤𝙧𝙣. While holding the bow, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to fire a magical arrow of pure light at a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you, causing that creature to regain 2d6 + 2 hit points.

𝙏𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘼𝙧𝙧𝙤𝙬. When you make a ranged attack with the bow, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause the fired arrow to transform into a spectral, charging pegasus. On a hit, the target takes an extra 3d6 force damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target of the attack is already prone, you ignore the normal disadvantage imposed on ranged attack rolls against prone creatures and make the roll with advantage instead.
