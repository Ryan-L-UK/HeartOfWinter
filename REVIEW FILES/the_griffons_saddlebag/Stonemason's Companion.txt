Stonemason's Companion
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

These tools were crafted by a lonely stonemason with a desire for a companion. You gain a +1 bonus to ability checks made using this set of mason's tools.

If you are proficient with mason's tools, you can use these tools to carve 10gp worth of fine stone into the shape of a Small or smaller creature over the course of a full workday, mimicking the effects of the "find familiar" spell with the following changes: the familiar is an elemental and, while it remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stone statue.

When the familiar falls to 0 hit points, the spell ends and it crumbles into a pile of nonmagical rubble. While a familiar created by the "stonemason's companion" exists, you can't use the tools to create another one.
