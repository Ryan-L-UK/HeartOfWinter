Slaying Longbow
Weapon (longbow), legendary (requires attunement by a good-aligned creature)
___

This powerful longbow originally served a solar, one of the mighty celestials that guard the heavens from evil. Normally unwieldy in the hands of mortals, this bow was bestowed upon a heroic human centuries ago and has been carefully passed down ever since. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this magic weapon, it takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage.

In addition, when you roll a 20 on a ranged attack roll made with this bow against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die. A creature is immune to this effect if it is good-aligned or has legendary actions. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 radiant damage from the hit.
