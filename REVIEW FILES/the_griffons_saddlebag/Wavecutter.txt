⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Wavecutter
Weapon (any axe), rare
___

This axe has a single pearl set at the center of its blade. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you take the Attack action using this axe, you can forgo one of your attacks to swing the axe in front of you and speak its command word. When you do, the axe emits a crashing wave of magical water. The wave is 10 feet tall and extends from you in a 30-foot cone, after which it spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in the area within 30 feet of it before the water vanishes. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
