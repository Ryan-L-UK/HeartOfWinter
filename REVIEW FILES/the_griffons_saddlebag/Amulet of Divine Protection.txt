💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Amulet of Divine Protection Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)
___

While wearing this amulet, you gain the effect of the "shield of faith" spell, granting you a +2 to bonus to AC. Whenever you take damage for the first time on a turn while wearing it, you must make a Constitution saving throw (as if you were concentrating on a spell). On a failed save, the amulet's effect is suppressed for 1 minute. Maintaining the effect of this amulet does not prevent you from concentrating on a different spell.
