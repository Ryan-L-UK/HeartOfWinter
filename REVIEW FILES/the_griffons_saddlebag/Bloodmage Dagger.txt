Bloodmage Dagger
Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
___

This roughly hewn obsidian dagger is razor sharp and can be used as a spellcasting focus. Its handle is covered in small holes that drink in whatever blood runs down the blade. There's a small reservoir for blood at the dagger's pommel that seems to never completely fill. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon.

The dagger has 5 charges and regains 1d3+2 expended charges each day at dusk. You can expend 1 charge as an action to make a melee spell attack using your spell attack bonus against a living creature you can see within 5 feet of you. When you do, an illusory crimson dagger sweeps out towards the creature. A creature hit by the attack takes necrotic damage equal to 3d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and you regain hit points equal to the damage dealt. If the target of the attack is a construct, plant, or undead creature, you don't regain any health in this way.

Alternatively, while holding the dagger you can expend 1 or more of its charges when you cast a spell using a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level spell slot. The spell must target either a single creature or yourself. The spell slot you use to cast this spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher for each charge you expend in this way. You can't increase the slot level of a spell in this way beyond 5th level. You also sacrifice 1 Hit Die for each charge you expend in this way. Roll a number of Hit Dice equal to the number of expended charges and take necrotic damage equal to the total you roll on them. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. If expending charges in this way causes you to fall to 0 hit points, the spell fails and you fall unconscious.
