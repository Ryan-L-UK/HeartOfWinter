Staff of the Vineyard
Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, monk, or ranger)
___

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. A clutch of up to 10 grapes hangs from the end of the staff's magical length of vine. A creature within reach of the staff can use an action to eat one of the grapes, which duplicates the effect of eating a berry from the "goodberry" spell. 1d10 eaten grapes regrow on the clutch daily at dawn.

While holding the staff, you can use an action to cast the "entangle" spell from it (save DC 13), causing twisting grapevines to sprout from the ground in the target area. If a creature restrained by these vines makes a Strength check to free itself and fails, that creature becomes magically drunk until the end of its next turn. A drunk creature is poisoned for the duration. Once this property of the staff has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
