Bag of Sundrops
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This small, colorful bag is filled with 1d6 + 4 golden, marble-like orbs called sundrops that glow softly when held. As an action, you can throw a sundrop at a point or object within 30 feet. When you do, the orb explodes into a dazzling pillar of light that lasts for 10 minutes. The pillar is a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder of bright light centered on the point where the sundrop shattered. The light is sunlight.
