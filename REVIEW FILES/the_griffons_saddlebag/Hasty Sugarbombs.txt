🍬 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Hasty Sugarbombs
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This tasty morsel is packed with a magical ingredient that increases your movement speed by 5 feet for the next hour when eaten as an action. Once the magical effects wear off, your muscles begin to slightly ache from the strain, but your tastebuds hunger for more. The effects of every additional hasty sugarbomb you eat before finishing a long rest only last for one minute, and incur a level of exhaustion for each additional one eaten once their effects expire.
