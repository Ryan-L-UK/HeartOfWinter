Cinnabar Rapier
Weapon (rapier), rare
___

This magic rapier's blade is alchemically coated in a thin but toxic layer of cinnabar. The weapon has 10 charges and regains 1d8+2 expended charges at the dawn of each day. When you hit a creature with this weapon you can expend one or more of its charges. The blade's poison leeches into the blood of the creature you struck to deal an extra 1d4 poison damage for each charge expended in this way.
