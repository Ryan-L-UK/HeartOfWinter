Murk Blowgun
Weapon (blowgun), uncommon
___

A hefty blowgun used by the inhabitants of the Murk: a series of deadly swamps whose waters are polluted with an uncanny poison. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this magic blowgun, that creature takes an extra 1d4 poison damage. When you roll a 20 on a ranged attack roll made with the blowgun, the target must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. It is incapacitated while poisoned in this way.

In addition, this blowgun can be wielded as a magic club.
