⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Dagger of First Light
Weapon (dagger), uncommon
___

You have advantage on initiative rolls while holding this weapon. If you're first in the initiative order, your speed is increased by 15 feet for the first round of combat.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to speak the weapon's command word to cause its blade to glow. The glowing weapon sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While the weapon is glowing, it deals radiant damage instead of piercing. You can use a bonus action to speak the weapon's command word again to cause its light to fade and return to normal.
