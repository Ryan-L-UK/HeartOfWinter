Ring of Gestures 
Ring, common
___

This gaudy ring has a delicately carved pink gem in the shape of a hand at its center. While wearing this ring, you can cast the *minor illusions* cantrip at will to enlarge, reduce, and change the color of the hand wearing the ring or any of its fingers. In addition, whenever you make a gesture with the hand wearing this ring, the pink gemstone moves to mimic the gesture and remains that way until you make a new one.
