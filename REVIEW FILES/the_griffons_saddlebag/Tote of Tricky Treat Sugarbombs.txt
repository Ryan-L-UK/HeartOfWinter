Wondrous item, common
___

This canvas bag holds 5d8 + 10 clove and pumpkin candies inside. A small illusory face appears over the sewn-on pumpkin at night. Each candy has a minor magical effect that lasts for 1 minute unless otherwise specified. Some effects are pleasant, whereas some are mischievous. You can eat a candy as an action. When you do, roll on the table below to determine the candy's effect:

d20 | Effect
—
1 |  The candy seemed to have spoiled, forcing you to succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or spend your action on your next turn retching and reeling.
—
2 |  Your face appears to melt: revealing the skull beneath it. The effect is harmless and illusory.
—
3 |  Any food you eat or water you drink taste like ash and blood, respectively.
—
4 |  Other creatures' eyes appear to be hollowed out and blackened.
—
5 |  Your ears turn a different, vibrant color at that start of each of your turns.
—
6 |  Your hair falls out and regrows over the next minute.
—
7 |  Your laughter becomes maniacal, and you have trouble stopping once you've started.
—
8 |  Your pupils resemble a snake's.
—
9 |  You hear a fly near your ear, but you can neither see it nor swat it away.
—
10 |  Your skin turns orange, and light spills forth from your eyes and mouth, casting bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for another 10 feet.
—
11 |  Confetti bursts from the top of your head, and small children can be heard laughing.
—
12 |  You sprout tiny, flightless bat wings.
—
13 |  You know the location of the nearest pumpkin within 1 mile.
—
14 |  Nearby crows and ravens land on your shoulders or outstretched arm.
—
15 |  A friendly, floppy wizard hat appears on your head. After 1 minute, it disappears in a cloud of stars.
—
16 |  Any alcohol in your stomach or that you drink becomes nonalcoholic.
—
17 |  Your voice becomes smooth and golden, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to Charisma (performance) checks to sing. If you are already proficient with this skill, you add double your proficiency bonus instead. ...Continued below in the comments!
