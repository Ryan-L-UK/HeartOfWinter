💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Petal Dancer Ward
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This cape is made of colorful, aromatic petals. As you walk, a dusting of petals drift behind you, disappearing before they touch the ground. You can change the color of the petals using a bonus action. While you wear this cape, you can cast the "druidcraft" cantrip at will, and creatures with a sense of smell make attacks of opportunity against you with disadvantage.
