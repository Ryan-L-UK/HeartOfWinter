Rod of Instant Pillars Rod, uncommon
___

This rod looks like a miniature stone pillar. You can use an action to set it down in an unoccupied space on solid ground within 5 feet of you and speak its command word. The rod then expands upward, creating a vertical pillar made of stone in that space. The pillar is a 5-foot-diameter cylinder grows upward to fill the available space, up to 20 feet tall. Regardless of its size, it always weighs 500 pounds while in its pillar form. A creature can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check, moving the pillar on a success. If the pillar is moved in any way, it magically returns to its normal rod form.

The pillar remains until it's moved. When you speak the rod's command word, you can choose the style, color, and apparent quality of the pillar it creates.
