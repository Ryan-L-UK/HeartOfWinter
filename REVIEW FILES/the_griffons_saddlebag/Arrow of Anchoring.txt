⚔️ 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Arrow of Anchoring
Weapon (arrow or bolt), uncommon
___

This magic piece of ammunition weighs 1 pound but otherwise flies exactly like a normal arrow or bolt. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this ammunition, that creature must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is grappled by the arrow for 1 minute as the chain magically extends and wraps around the target. On a success, the creature's speed is halved until the start of your next turn instead. A creature grappled by the arrow in this way can use an action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect and freeing itself on a success.
After this effect ends, the ammunition clatters to the ground and becomes a 2-foot length of nonmagical chain.
