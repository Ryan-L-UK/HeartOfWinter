💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Mourningsteel Obol Wondrous item, rare
___

This coin is made from mourningsteel, a metal found below battlefields that have been steeped in blood. A hole at the top allows it to be worn as a soldier's pendant.

When the coin is placed in the mouth of a dead creature, that creature gains the benefits of the "gentle repose" spell, provided that the creature hasn't been dead for longer than 1 day. Once placed, the coin can't be removed from the creature's mouth until the effects of the spell end. For the duration of the spell, if the creature is attacked or its body is in some way desecrated, a "spiritual weapon" is summoned from the coin, which remains for 1 minute. The ghostly weapon takes the form of a weapon wielded by the dead creature in life or some other form that represents the values that creature held. This version of the spell is cast at 4th level and has a +7 spell attack bonus and +4 spellcasting ability modifier. The weapon acts on initiative count 20 and is controlled by the GM. On its turn, it can move up to 60 feet, instead of 20, although it can't move farther than 60 feet away from the coin. Once summoned in this way, the "spiritual weapon" can't reappear for 1d4 hours.

If the dead creature is returned to life while the coin is in its mouth, the coin is magically transformed into a lustrous metal called solacesteel and then loses its magic. Otherwise, the coin simply loses its magic and remains as mourningsteel after 10 days when the "gentle repose" spell ends.
