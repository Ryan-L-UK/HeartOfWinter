Luckleaf
Wondrous item, uncommon
___

This plant is commonly thought to be a special kind of clover. However, a luckleaf is a separate, magical species that grows in random locations across the Material Plane and has 5 leaves. While a "luckleaf" is on your person, you can choose to expend any number of its leaves (no action required) to increase or reduce the total of any roll you make by 1 for each expended leaf, up to the maximum or minimum result on the die. This roll can be made with any die, and you can only use one "luckleaf" at a time in this way. You can wait to use this property until after seeing the total of the roll, but before the GM determines the outcome of it. An expended leaf withers and turns to dust. When the last leaf is expended, the plant becomes a nonmagical stem.
