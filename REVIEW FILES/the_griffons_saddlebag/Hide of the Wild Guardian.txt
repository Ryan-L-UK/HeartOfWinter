Hide of the Wild Guardian Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a druid)
___

This well-worn gray bearskin cloak has been passed down from druid to druid for generations. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:

• You gain a +1 bonus to ability checks and saving throws.

• You can use your Wild Shape feature up to three times between rests, instead of twice, unless you can already use it more.

• The maximum challenge rating beast you can transform into with your Wild Shape increases by 1.

• While transformed into a beast, you gain a +3 bonus to AC, as well as to attack and damage rolls with natural weapons, even if the cloak merges into your new form.
