Couatl Herald's Radiance
Staff, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster of good alignment)
___

This magic wooden staff was enchanted by a powerful couatl. This staff has 5 charges. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spellcasting ability modifier and spell save DC: "create food and water", "cure wounds" (2nd-level version), "lesser restoration", "protection from poison", "sanctuary", or "shield". The staff regains 1d3 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.

𝙁𝙡𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝘾𝙤𝙪𝙖𝙩𝙡𝙨. While you're attuned to 3 items with this feature, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. If you already have a flying speed, this speed is in addition to your existing flying speed.
