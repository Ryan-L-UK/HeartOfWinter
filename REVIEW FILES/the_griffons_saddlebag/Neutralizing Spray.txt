Neutralizing Spray Wondrous item, common
___

This small bottle contains a mysterious clear liquid. It has an inflated cushion on its stopper that can be squeezed to spray the liquid from a small nozzle. You can use an action to spray the bottle into a space within 5 feet of you, dousing the area in a 5-foot cube. Any creature or object within the area becomes magically cleaned, as if by the “prestidigitation” spell, and if it would still have an odor even after being cleaned, the smell is suppressed for 10 minutes.

The bottle contains enough liquid for 4 uses and regains any used liquid daily at dawn. If you use the last of the liquid, roll a d4. On a 1, the liquid no longer magically replenishes.
