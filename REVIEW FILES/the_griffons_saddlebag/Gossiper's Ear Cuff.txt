Gossiper's Ear Cuff Wondrous item, rare
___

While wearing this ear cuff, you can use an action to cast the "message" cantrip from it. In addition, you automatically hear the message of any spell that targets a creature within 120 feet of you, such as by a "message" or "sending" spell. Messages overheard in this way sound like whispers to you, regardless of the original message.
