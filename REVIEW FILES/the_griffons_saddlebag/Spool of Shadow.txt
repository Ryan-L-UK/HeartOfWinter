💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Spool of Shadow Wondrous item, common
___

Thin wisps of smoke gently rise from this spool of magic black thread. You can use the entire spool of thread to repair an article of clothing or embroider a design on one instead. In either case, it takes 1 hour to sew the entire spool's thread on an article of clothing, at which point the thread's magic is transferred to it. While a creature is wearing the article of clothing, it can add 1d4 to the total of any Dexterity (Stealth) check it makes. Once this property has been used for a third time, its magic is lost.
