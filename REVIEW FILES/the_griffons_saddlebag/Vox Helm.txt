Vox Helm
Wondrous item, common
___

This plated helmet completely covers the head of the creature wearing it and can alter the sound of their voice. The voice is obviously modified, sounding slightly unnatural and enchanted. The wearer can mentally adjust the pitch, masculinity or femininity, and reverberation of its voice at will (no action required).
