Detective's Monocle Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
___

While wearing this monocle, you have advantage on any Intelligence (Investigation) check you make. In addition, you can use an action to twist the monocle's lens to view the area around you as it was at a time within the last 24 hours. When you do, you must specify either an exact time or time relative to the present, such as "At three o'clock" or "Three hours ago," respectively. You then see the area within 30 feet of you as it appeared at the chosen time, including any objects or creatures that were there at that time. The area does not move with you. Any creature that appears within the area as part of this effect, including anything worn or carried by it, is blurry beyond recognition. Furthermore, the area appears in shades of gray, rather than color. You can view the area in this way for as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 10 minutes. It ends early if you move outside of the area or if you end the effect (no action required). Once this property of the monocle has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
