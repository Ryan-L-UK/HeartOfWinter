Gorgon Potion Potion, rare
___

This potion contains trace amounts of gorgon blood. When you drink this potion, you're immune to being petrified for 1d4 hours. If you're already petrified, another creature can apply the potion to you and suspend the effect for 1d4 hours instead. In either case, for the duration of the potion's effects, your skin hardens into flexible metal plates; your AC can't be lower than 18.

While under the effects of the potion, you can use an action to exhale a plume of green vapor from you in a 15-foot cone. When you do, the potion's effects on you end, and both you and any other creature within the area of the vapor must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must make another DC13 Constitution saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified for 1 minute.
