💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Ghostbow Bracer Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
___

This leather bracer has a blue gemstone embedded on its wrist, which glimmers with an ethereal light. While wearing it, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls on ranged attacks made with longbows and shortbows.

𝙎𝙪𝙢𝙢𝙤𝙣 𝘽𝙤𝙬. You can use a bonus action to summon a spectral longbow or shortbow from the bracer's gemstone. The bow is weightless, allowing you to ignore the longbow's normal heavy property while holding it. The bow remains until you're holding another weapon, until you drop it, or until you dismiss it (no action required). While the weapon persists, it sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. It creates its own arrows, which magically appear in a knocked position whenever you draw the bow. Hit or miss, an arrow disappears after the attack or if you release the bowstring without firing the arrow.

Regardless of what bow you summon, it deals force damage instead of piercing damage.

𝘾𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙜𝙚𝙨. The bracer has 4 charges for the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn. The available properties are determined by the type of summoned bow.

𝙂𝙧𝙞𝙢 𝙎𝙝𝙤𝙩 (𝙇𝙤𝙣𝙜𝙗𝙤𝙬 𝙤𝙧 𝙎𝙝𝙤𝙧𝙩𝙗𝙤𝙬). When you hit a target with an arrow that was created by the summoned bow, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 2d8 force damage to the target. This damage is in addition to the attack's normal damage.

𝙋𝙞𝙚𝙧𝙘𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘽𝙡𝙖𝙨𝙩 (𝙇𝙤𝙣𝙜𝙗𝙤𝙬). When you take the Attack action using the summoned bow, you can replace one or more of your attacks with a special attack using the bow. You expend 2 charges per attack you replace in this way. When you do, you draw forth a cool beam of light from the weapon, instead of a spectral arrow. You fire this beam of light in a line from you that's 5 feet wide and 100 feet long. Each creature within the line must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d8 force damage.

𝙎𝙩𝙚𝙥𝙨𝙝𝙤𝙩 (𝙎𝙝𝙤𝙧𝙩𝙗𝙤𝙬). You can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to make one ranged attack against a creature using the summoned bow. On a hit, you teleport to an unoccupied space...
