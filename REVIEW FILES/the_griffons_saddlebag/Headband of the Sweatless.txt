💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Headband of the Sweatless
Wondrous item, common
___

These vibrant silk headbands come in a variety of colors and patterns. While wearing the headband, you magically don't get wet when you perspire, but are still naturally cooled as if you had. In addition, the first time you make a Constitution saving throw to resist the effects of extreme heat, add 1d4 to the total of the roll. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
