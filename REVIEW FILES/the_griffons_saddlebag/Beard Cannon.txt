💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Beard Cannon
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
___

This item appears to be a wide, cylindrical hair cuff used for taming unruly hair. The cuff is 4 inches in height and diameter and weighs 1 pound. As part of attuning to the cuff, you must pull it onto your hair or beard, which must be at least one foot long in order to fit. When you finish attuning to the cuff, 6 smaller, spherical beads appear and weave themselves into the hair nearby.

When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of the attacks to point the hair cuff at a target within range and speak its command word. When you do, the cuff magically retracts any hair pulled through it and fires 1 of the smaller beads through its exposed opening. Make a ranged weapon attack using the magic cuff, which has a normal range of 15 feet and a long range of 30 feet. You are proficient with the attack. When fired, the spherical bead magically grows to become fist-sized, and it deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit.
After the attack, the retracted hair magically reappears through the cuff, and the fired bead is lost. 1d6 fired beads magically reappear in your hair daily at dawn. When not in use as a weapon, the item is indistinguishable from a normal hair cuff.
