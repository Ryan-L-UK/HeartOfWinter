Ouroboros Ring Ring, rare
___

A silver serpent twists around itself three times to form the shape of this ring. Its tail is bitten by its jeweled head. While wearing the ring, when a creature that you can see (including yourself) rolls a d20, you can use your reaction to speak the ring's command word and roll a d8. You make this decision after knowing the result of the roll, but before the GM declares the outcome.

When you do, you alter the number rolled on the d20, before any modifiers are added to it. You can choose to either add or subtract the number you rolled on the d8 to or from the d20. The d20 is treated as if it had originally rolled the altered number. If the d8 would cause the number rolled on the d20 to be greater than 20 or less than 1, continue to count up or down as though the next number after 20 were 1, or the number below 1 were 20. For example, a creature rolls a 19 on its d20 for an attack roll against you, before any modifiers are added to the roll. You use your reaction to roll a 4 on the d8 and add it to the 19, causing the d20 to be treated as if it had rolled a 3.

Once this property of the ring has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
