💎 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺!
Vain Virtuoso's Violin
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)
___

This finely-crafted instrument is inlaid with intricate pearl designs. When you give another creature a Bardic Inspiration die using this violin, you gain one yourself, which is a d4.

𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚. This violin is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. When a creature that you can see (including yourself) fails an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw after adding the bonus from your Bardic Inspiration to the total of the roll, you take psychic damage equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die as you lose faith in your own abilities. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.
