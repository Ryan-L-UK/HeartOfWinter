Each creature of the angel's choice that is within 120 feet of it and is aware of it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. The DC for this saving throw is the same as for the angel's Innate Spellcasting trait. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to that angel's Goldnight Menace for the next 24 hours."]}}}},"cr":"11","hasToken":true,"hasFluff":true,"hasFluffImages":true}
