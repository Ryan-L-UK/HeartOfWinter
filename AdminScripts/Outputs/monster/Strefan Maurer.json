A vampire can't cross running water that shows the reflection of the moon, and water blessed by Avacyn ({@item Holy Water (flask)|PHB|holy water}) burns vampire flesh like acid. A vampire's reflection in silver (including a silver-backed glass mirror) appears as the vampire would have looked without the vampiric conditionâ€”neither its true appearance nor its glamer, but a normal human, flaws and all. For that reason, vampires go to great lengths to avoid mirrors, and the presence of silver in any form is unsettling to them."]}}}},"hasToken":true,"hasFluff":true,"hasFluffImages":true}
