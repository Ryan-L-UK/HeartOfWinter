Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means. Once per turn, when the angel hits a creature with an attack using this weapon, it can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes {@damage 1d4} necrotic damage for each time the angel has wounded it, and it can then make a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success."]}}}},"hasToken":true,"hasFluff":true,"hasFluffImages":true}
