A successful {@dc 12} Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check identifies them as such. When the devil rolls a 20 on an attack roll with a claw, the target is decapitated. (At your option, the attack can instead deal an extra {@damage 6d8} slashing damage.) A target is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, has legendary actions, doesn't have or need a head, or if you decide that the target is too large for its head to be cut off by the devil's claws. If removed, the shards lose their magical powers."]},{"name":"Teleportation Bracelets","entries":["Local teleportation-field bracelets encircle the devil's arms and tail.
