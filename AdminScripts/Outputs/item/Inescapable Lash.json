You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has a reach of 20 feet. When you hit a creature or object using this whip, you can attempt to {@action grapple} the target as a bonus action.","While you have a creature {@condition grappled} using this whip, you can use your action to either pull the creature up to 20 feet toward you, or cause the creature to be {@condition restrained} until you let go of the whip. A creature {@condition restrained} in this way can escape by making a successful Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check as an action. The DC of this check equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier."]}
