However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An {@spell identify} spell reveals its true nature.","If you drink it, you take {@damage 3d6} poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned}. At the start of each of your turns while you are {@condition poisoned} in this way, you take {@damage 3d6} poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by {@dice 1d6}. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0."],"lootTables":["Magic Item Table B"]}
