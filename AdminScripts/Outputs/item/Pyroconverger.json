It carries a risk of malfunction each time you use it.","As an action, you can cause the Pyroconverger to project fire in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 4d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.","Each time you use the Pyroconverger, roll a {@dice d10} and add the number of times you have used it since your last long rest. If the total is 11 or higher, the Pyroconverger malfunctions: you take {@damage 4d6} fire damage, and you can't use the Pyroconverger again until you finish a long rest."],"hasFluffImages":true}
