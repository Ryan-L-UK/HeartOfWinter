While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (using your spell save DC) or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the target can't regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. A {@spell greater restoration}, {@spell remove curse}, or similar spell ends the curse on the target."]},{"type":"entries","name":"The Forgotten One","entries":["The bodiless life force of a dead {@creature archmage} empowers the staff and is imprisoned within it.

Each time a creature other than {@creature Acererak|ToA} expends any of the staff's charges, there is a {@chance 50} chance that the life force tries to possess the staff wielder. The wielder must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be possessed, becoming an NPC under the DM's control. If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a {@spell dispel evil and good} spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the insane spirit of the dead {@creature archmage} attempts to destroy the staff."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Destroying the Staff","entries":["A creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 132 ({@damage 24d10}) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the staff is destroyed, the life force of the Forgotten One is released to the afterlife. Where it goes is anyone's guess."]}]}
