The energy then detonates into a 10-foot-radius sphere of turbulent wind and thunder centered on that point, and each creature in that sphere must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 3d6} thunder damage, and it can't take reactions until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.","Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.","It's up to you to decide whether a character has proficiency with a firearm. Characters in most D&D worlds wouldn't have such proficiency.
