When the axe hits a plant, whether an ordinary plant or a plant creature, the target takes an extra {@damage 1d8} slashing damage. When a creature of non-good alignment wields the axe, it sprouts thorns whenever its wielder makes an attack with it. These thorns prick the wielder for 1 piercing damage after the attack is made, and this damage is considered magical."]}
