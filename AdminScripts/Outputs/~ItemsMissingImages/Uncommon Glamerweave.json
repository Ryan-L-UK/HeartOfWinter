{"name":"Uncommon Glamerweave","source":"ERLW","page":277,"rarity":"uncommon","wondrous":true,"entries":["Glamerweave is clothing imbued with harmless illusory magic. While wearing these clothes, you can use a bonus action to create a moving illusory pattern within the cloth. Alternatively, you can have the pattern rise from the cloth. For example, a glamerweave gown might be wreathed in harmless, illusory flames, while a glamerweave hat might have illusory butterflies fluttering around it.","When you make a Charisma ({@skill Performance}) or Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check while wearing the glamerweave, you can roll a {@dice d4} and add the number rolled to the check. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn."]}
