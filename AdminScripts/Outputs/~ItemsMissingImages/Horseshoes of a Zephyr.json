While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering {@condition exhaustion} from a forced march."],"lootTables":["Magic Item Table D"]}
