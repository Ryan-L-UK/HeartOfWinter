Each time you subsequently drink a potion of longevity, there is 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead age by {@dice 1d6 + 6} years. Suspended in this amber liquid are a scorpion's tail, an adder's fang, a dead spider, and a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened."],"lootTables":["Magic Item Table D"]}
