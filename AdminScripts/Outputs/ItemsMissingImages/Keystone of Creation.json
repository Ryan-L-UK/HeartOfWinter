If you are attuned to one keystone when you attune to a second keystone, the keystones combine to become a single artifact (utilizing a single attunement slot), combining their features and their fates forevermore. You cannot attune to, and thus combine, more than three keystones at once."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Destroying a Keystone","entries":["A keystone is an artifact in its own right and impervious to most damage, but a {@spell disintegrate} spell is sufficient to destroy an unattuned keystone.","After it has been attuned at least once, a given keystone requires attunement to maintain its magical power. Otherwise, its creations on the Material Plane gradually rot and decay over {@dice 1d12 + 1} days, and a demiplane relying on the keystone collapses over {@dice 1d20 + 10} minutes. Additional destructive forces like fire may hasten the destruction. A demiplane created or upheld by a keystone ejects all creatures within it to their home planes when it collapses.","When a keystone's creation is fully destroyed, the keystone becomes an inert, powerless rock. If the {@item Stone of Creation|AitFR-AVT} is destroyed, all its keystones break attunement, lose all magical properties, and their creations decay or collapse to nothing.","If it reaches the Elemental Chaos or is struck by a forked, metal rod attuned to the Elemental Chaos (as per the {@spell plane shift} spell), a keystone is destroyed."]},{"type":"section","entries":[{"type":"entries","name":"Construction Details","entries":["You can customize a keystone's creation with cosmetic details you can imagine.

The edges of this space are solid and impassable but may be {@condition invisible}, so that your space can appear to go on forever if you wish. With additional keystones, you can add an additional square mile to your creation, adding or combining terrain types.","Each square mile can include a single structure up to the size of {@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion}, with all the attendant servants and feasts, or any number of smaller structures that together equal a magnificent mansion in total area.","You cannot create flora or fauna that deal damage or otherwise harm creatures. If you create cliffs, waters, or other natural features, however, creatures in the space might fall, drown, or otherwise be harmed."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Physical Structure Design","entries":["With a single keystone, you can create a structure akin to a mighty fortress with the added flexibility to customize that fortress not only for cosmetic details but for substantive effects. With a single keystone, you can rearrange the walls, open spaces, floors, doors, and other features of the mighty fortress provided you do not exceed 150 10-foot-wide cubes of interior space. Your fortress can reach across a creek, river, or other waters. It can take reckless or even dangerous shapes to include deep pits, flooded chambers, and so on. Your design, once conjured, is not guaranteed to be capable of supporting its own weight or surviving the stresses of attacks, weather, or time.","You may post any number of your structure's servants as guards, if you wish. They have statistics identical to an unseen servant with the addition of a passive {@skill Perception} score equal to your own, though you cannot perceive through their senses. The servants can ring bells or otherwise manipulate the environment to raise an alarm."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Manifestations","entries":["Each place or structure conjured by a keystone of creation has special, unforeseen manifestations that affect its makeup and appearance. Some manifestations are beneficial, some are detrimental. These manifestations change each time a keystone is used to conjure a structure or place.
