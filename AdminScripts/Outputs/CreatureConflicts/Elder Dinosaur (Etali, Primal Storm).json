A storm cloud in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius instantly forms 100 feet in the air over the elder dinosaur when it is angered or becomes violent, as long as it is outdoors. On each of its turns, as an action, the elder dinosaur can choose a point it can see within 120 feet of it. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a {@dc 20} Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 ({@damage 6d6}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."]}],"action":[{"name":"Multiattack","entries":["The elder dinosaur can use its Frightful Presence and call down two lightning strikes from its Lightning Storm.
