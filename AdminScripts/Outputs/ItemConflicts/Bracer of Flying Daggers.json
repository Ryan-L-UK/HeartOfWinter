{"name":"Bracer of Flying Daggers","source":"WDH","page":190,"rarity":"rare","reqAttune":true,"wondrous":true,"entries":["This armband appears to have thin {@item dagger|phb|daggers} strapped to it. As an action, you can pull up to two magic daggers from the bracer and immediately hurl them, making a ranged attack with each dagger. A dagger vanishes if you don't hurl it right away, and the daggers disappear right after they hit or miss. The bracer never runs out of daggers."]}
