{"name":"Gunpowder Keg","source":"DMG","page":268,"type":"EXP","rarity":"none","weight":20,"value":25000,"age":"renaissance","entries":["Gunpowder is chiefly used to propel a bullet out of the barrel of a pistol or rifle, or it is formed into a bomb. Gunpowder is sold in small wooden kegs or in water-resistant powder horns.","Setting fire to a container full of gunpowder can cause it to explode, dealing fire damage to creatures within 10 feet of it ({@damage 7d6} for a keg). A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage. Setting fire to an ounce of gunpowder causes it to flare for 1 round, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet."]}
