{"name":"Instrument of Illusions","source":"XGE","page":137,"type":"INS","tier":"minor","rarity":"common","reqAttune":true,"wondrous":true,"entries":["While you are playing this musical instrument, you can create harmless, illusory visual effects within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on the instrument. If you are a bard, the radius increases to 15 feet. Sample visual effects include luminous musical notes, a spectral dancer, butterflies, and gently falling snow. The magical effects have neither substance nor sound, and they are obviously illusory. The effects end when you stop playing."]}
