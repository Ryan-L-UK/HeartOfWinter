Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a sphere of annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes {@damage 4d10} force damage.","The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 Ã— your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking {@damage 4d10} force damage.","If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control, you make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.","If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the {@spell gate} spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a {@item portable hole}, the DM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.",{"type":"table","colLabels":["{@dice d100}","Result"],"colStyles":["col-1 text-center","col-11"],"rows":[["01-50","The sphere is destroyed."],["51-85","The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space."],["86-00","A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence."]]}],"lootTables":["Magic Item Table I"]}
