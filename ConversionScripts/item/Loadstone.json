An {@spell identify} spell reveals the stone's true nature. If you use the {@action Dash} or {@action Disengage} action while the stone is on your person, its curse activates. Until the curse is broken with {@spell remove curse} or similar magic, your speed is reduced by 5 feet, and your maximum load and maximum lift capacities are halved. You also become unwilling to part with the stone."]}]}
