In the hands of an illithid, this magic weapon strips away a creature's will to survive as it also strips away flesh, dealing an extra {@damage 2d4} psychic damage to any target it hits. Any creature that takes psychic damage from the mind lash must also succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."]}
