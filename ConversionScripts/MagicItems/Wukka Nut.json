{"name":"Wukka Nut","source":"ToA","page":205,"type":"G","rarity":"unknown","value":100,"entries":["These fist-sized nuts grow on wukka trees, which are popular haunts for {@creature jaculi|ToA}, {@creature su-monster|ToA|su-monsters}, and {@creature zorbo|ToA|zorbos}. A wukka nut rattles when shaken, causing its shell to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. This magical light fades after 1 minute, but shaking the nut again causes the light to reappear. If the shell of the nut is cracked open, it loses its magic."]}
