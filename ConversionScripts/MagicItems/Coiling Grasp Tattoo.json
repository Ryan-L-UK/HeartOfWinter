While the tattoo is on your skin, you can, as an action, cause the tattoo to extrude into inky tendrils, which reach for a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take {@damage 3d6} force damage and be {@condition grappled} by you. As an action, the creature can escape the grapple by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. The grapple also ends if you halt it (no action required), if the creature is ever more than 15 feet away from you, or if you use this tattoo on a different creature.",{"type":"entries","name":"Tattoo Attunement","entries":["To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. If you have multiple magic tattoos, they count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to.","If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in the closest unoccupied space to you."]}]}
