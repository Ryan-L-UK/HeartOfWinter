# Downtime Activities

W &nbsp;&nbsp;hile your character is not adventuring, they can be performing _downtime activities_ that you pick from the list below. These activities all take time to complete, measured in _workweeks_ of 5 days, and usually also require money or other _resources_. Days of downtime activity do not need to be consecutive. Some activities can be completed by characters working together. Whislt most of these activities use the Adventurers League model, there are some subtle and key changes.

Sometimes characters may wish to pursue some solo adventuring or activities, so they may wish to use some, or all of their downtime. When it comes to adventures, there are a few options, you may:

- Pick up a bounty from the local message board for a reward.
- Investigate the rumour of a hidden magical item in the area.
- Go on a general expedition to see what you can find.

**Resources:** Each adventure, quest or bounty has its own gold, time or resource requirements, so depending what you would like to do, speak with your Dungeon Master to agree all the requirements.
