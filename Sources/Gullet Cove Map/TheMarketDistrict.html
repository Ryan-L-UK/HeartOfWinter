  <h1>The Market District</h1>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <br />
  <h2>General Notes</h2>
  <p>
    You wander through the streets of Gullet Cove, and come across the market,
    which is located in the very centre of town. It seems that the vendors are
    organised by raw materials and commodities on one half of the market,
    finished products on the other half. The market is known for being a pretty
    rough and tumble place, and is astonishingly well-kempt. The most important
    thing about the market is no two days are the same, so expect the venders
    and their wares to change regularly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The merchants of the town are a proud people and take pride in their wares.
    Be warned that whilst bartering is certainly encouraged, some merchants
    won’t take kindly to the suggestion their wares are sub-standard.
  </p>

  <h2>The Copper Pitcher</h2>
  <p>
    Owned by Oakie Thompson and Mokie Thompson; a pair of twin spaniels who
    finish each others sentences. The Copper Pitcher is a bric-a-brac stand,
    with dozens of different items all in differing states of disrepair. There
    is seldom anything of real value here, but occasionally they have been known
    to stumble upon the odd random magical item. Although they would never know
    its worth unless someone told them.

  <p>
    Owned by McIvor Glistenhame, a half-elf with a constant frown of
    concentration. Smell My Posy is a small flower stand, with artfully arranged
    bouquets of roses, delicately laced with dried seaweed. She also has a stock
    of various plants and seeds, but most of them are little more than
    decorative items.

  <h2>The Calm Train</h2>
  <p>
    Previously the home of a reputable narcotics cafe, it has long since closed
    down. The doors have been shut for many moons, however that has only served
    to hide the illegal activities going on beneath the surface. Under the calm
    train is ‘The Pet Shop’, an illegal action space for awoken animals to be
    traded and bartered to the highest bidder. Since the incident with the
    Wereshark, the doors have since been sealed up tight by The Watch, and they
    have a guard regularly patrolling the closed stores to ensure nothing
    illegal is taking place.
