  "Desc2_input": "Dreaming is not a new concept to you, but vivid dreams are certainly a new experience. Everything before you is so clear it could be touched, smelt, seen. Before you lays a man in a bed sleeping. You are not sure how you got into his house, but here you are, in the doorway, looking at his sleeping form. In a hand, you hold the crimson stone, and you take a deep breath. A sweet smell fills your lungs, like everything you have ever wanted eat lays before you, a perfect meal, a perfect banquet even. You walk towards the sleeping man, slowly, careful not to wake him, you wouldn’t want to disturb him. Like venison, any sign of panic has a tendency to ruin the meat, you don’t want risk the same here. ",

Your taste buds feel the rush of excitement and sweetness as you do so, this is everything you wanted, everything you were craving. The man doesn’t stir, but is clearly uncomfortable given the two fangs pressed into his neck. A few minutes go by and you reach your fill and walk away, feeling satisfied. The man looks pale, he is still alive, but only just. You appeared to leave him with JUST enough blood to continue existing. But you feel satisfied, for now. ",

You feel the same hunger as before, the same desire, and you’re not entirely sure, but every day you resist, it seems like its getting worse.  ",
