Before you lays a man in a bed sleeping. You are not sure how you got into his house, but here you are, in the doorway, looking at his sleeping form. In a hand, you hold the crimson stone, and you take a deep breath. A sweet smell fills your lungs, like everything you have ever wanted eat lays before you, a perfect meal, a perfect banquet even.

You lean forward, slowly, cautiously, before you take a bite. Your taste buds feel the rush of excitement and sweetness as you do so, this is everything you wanted, everything you were craving. The man doesn’t stir, but is clearly uncomfortable given the two fangs pressed into his neck. A few minutes go by and you reach your fill and walk away, feeling satisfied.
