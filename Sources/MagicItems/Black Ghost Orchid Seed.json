{"name":"Black Ghost Orchid Seed","source":"JttRC","page":0,"type":"G","rarity":"none","entries":["Every few years, a ghost orchid colony grows a black pod as thick as a human fist that holds three soft, black seeds. A creature that consumes one of these black seeds is affected by the spell {@spell feign death}. If the creature is unaware of the pod's effects or does not wish to be affected, it can resist the effect by succeeding on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Otherwise, it is considered to be a willing recipient of the spell."]}
