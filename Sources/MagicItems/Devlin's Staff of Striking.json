    "This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.",
    "The staff has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using it, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra {@damage 1d6} force damage. The staff regains {@dice 1d6 + 4} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.",
    "If you attune to this staff, you transform into a goat-humanoid hybrid over the course of 3 days. Tieflings are immune to this curse. Throughout the first day, shaggy fur begins to grow all over your body. After 24 hours, your eyes become goat-like, and stumpy horns sprout from your brow. On the last day, your fingers and toes meld into double digits, and the horns grow to full length. This transformation doesn't prevent you from wielding weapons or casting spells. {@spell Remove curse}, {@spell greater restoration}, or any other effect that ends a curse restores your original appearance, but only a {@spell wish} spell can rid the staff of its power to transform those who attune to it."
