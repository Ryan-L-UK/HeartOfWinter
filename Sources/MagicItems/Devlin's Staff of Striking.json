{"name":"Devlin's Staff of Striking","source":"ToA","page":141,"_copy":{"name":"Staff of Striking","source":"DMG","_mod":{"entries":{"mode":"appendArr","items":"If you attune to this staff, you transform into a goat-humanoid hybrid over the course of 3 days. Tieflings are immune to this curse. Throughout the first day, shaggy fur begins to grow all over your body. After 24 hours, your eyes become goat-like, and stumpy horns sprout from your brow. On the last day, your fingers and toes meld into double digits, and the horns grow to full length. This transformation doesn't prevent you from wielding weapons or casting spells. {@spell Remove curse}, {@spell greater restoration}, or any other effect that ends a curse restores your original appearance, but only a {@spell wish} spell can rid the staff of its power to transform those who attune to it."}}},"curse":true}
