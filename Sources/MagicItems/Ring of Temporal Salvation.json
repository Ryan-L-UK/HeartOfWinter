{"name":"Ring of Temporal Salvation","source":"EGW","page":269,"type":"RG","rarity":"rare","reqAttune":true,"entries":["If you die while wearing this gray crystal ring, you vanish and reappear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the space you left (or the nearest unoccupied space). You have a number of hit points equal to {@dice 3d6} + your Constitution modifier. If your hit point maximum is lower than the number of hit points you regain, your hit point maximum rises to a similar amount. If you have any levels of {@condition exhaustion}, reduce your level of {@condition exhaustion} by 1. Once the ring is used, it turns to dust and is destroyed."]}
