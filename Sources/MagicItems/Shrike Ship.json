A shrike ship's legs enable it to land safely on the ground. The ship can float but isn't built for traveling on water and sinks quickly in rough seas.","Standard weaponry on a shrike ship includes three ballistaeâ€”one on the forecastle, one in the middle of the top deck, and one on the sterncastle. In a desperate situation, the ship's reinforced bow can be used as a piercing ram."],"seeAlsoVehicle":["Shrike Ship|AAG"]}
