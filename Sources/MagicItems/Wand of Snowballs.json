  "I0D": "This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the Snilloc's snowball swarm spell (DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 2nd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.",

  "I1D": "The wand regains 1d6  + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge,  roll a d20. On a 1,  the wand erupts in a harmless pyrotechnic display and is destroyed."
