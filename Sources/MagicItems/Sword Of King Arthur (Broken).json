{"name":"Sword Of King Arthur (Broken)","type":"Weapon","rarity":"Artifact","source":"Homebrew","weaponCategory":"Simple weapon, Melee Weapon","dmgType":"Piercing","dmg1":"1d6","property":"Finesse","I0D":"This +1 longsword was previously owned by King Arthur. It is made of dragon bone and with a dragon-leather grip. It has rubies in its pommel and hilt. The sword grows warm and the rubies glow slightly when the sword is within 120 feet of a dragon. The blade of the sword has been shattered, all that remains is the hilt and a small portion of the blade. It is still sharp, although little more than a dagger in length.","I1H":"Finesse.","I1D":"When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.","I2H":"Light.","I2D":"A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.","I3H":"Thrown.","I3D":"If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property."}
