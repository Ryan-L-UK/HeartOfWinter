<h1 id="revels-end">Revel’s End</h1>
<p>
  Revel’s End is a panopticon, a prison configured in such a way that the
  activities of the prisoners can be closely monitored from a central location.
  Situated in the middle of the Trackless Sea, the prison is a single-story
  structure topped with battlements. Rising from the core of the panopticon is a
  tower that holds the prison’s administrative offices and guard barracks. Both
  the prison and the tower are carved from a tall, blade-shaped rock that rises
  high above the sea cliffs. This rock, called the Windbreak, shields the tower
  against the brutal winds that sweep down from the Reghed Glacier.
</p>
<p>
  One can approach Revel’s End by land, sea, or air. A pier allows prisoners to
  be taken from ships up an elevator to the prison, and a mooring dock at the
  top of the tower allows prisoners to be delivered by airship.
</p>
<p>
  Revel’s End is controlled by the Lords’ Alliance, a loose confederation of
  settlements whose current members include the cities of Baldur’s Gate,
  Mirabar, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, and Yartar; the towns of
  Amphail, Daggerford, and Longsaddle; and the dwarven stronghold of Mithral
  Hall. To be imprisoned in Revel’s End, one must have committed a serious crime
  against one or more of the member cities and been sentenced to a lengthy
  period of incarceration (typically a year or more).
</p>
<p>
  Each member of the Lords’ Alliance assigns one representative to Revel’s End,
  and together the representatives form a parole committee called the Absolution
  Council. Rarely are all ten council members present, since Revel’s End offers
  little in the way of comfort and amenities. If the council needs a tiebreaking
  vote to determine whether to commute a prisoner’s sentence, the prison
  warden—a neutral arbiter with no ties to any Lords’ Alliance member—casts the
  deciding vote.
</p>
<h2 id="prison-features">Prison Features</h2>
<p>
  The prison, hewn from stone, has 20-foot-high outer walls and flat,
  20-foot-high ceilings throughout. Additional information about the prison is
  summarized below:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Doors and Hatches.</strong> Each door and rooftop hatch is made of
  reinforced iron held shut by an
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Arcane Lock.png">arcane lock</a>
  spell. Prison personnel can open these doors and hatches normally. A locked
  door or hatch is too strong to be shouldered or kicked open, but it can be
  destroyed if it takes enough damage. A door or hatch has AC 19, a damage
  threshold of 10, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Heating.</strong> Interior spaces are magically heated. The
  temperature in these areas is a constant 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees
  Celsius). The exterior of the prison, including the guard towers, is 0 degrees
  Fahrenheit (−18 degrees Celsius) or colder. Creatures outside the prison are
  exposed to extreme cold (see below).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Lighting.</strong> Unless a location states otherwise, the courtyard,
  corridors, rooms, and staircases are brightly lit with
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Continual Flame.png"
    >continual flame</a
  >
  spells cast on wall sconces. (The unlit cells in area R17 are exceptions.) In
  some locations, the magical lights can be dimmed or suppressed, as noted in
  the text.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Prison Guards.</strong> The prison has a garrison of 75 guards (use
  the
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Veteran.png">veteran</a>
  stat block) who work eight-hour shifts. Two-thirds of the garrison is off duty
  and resting in area R19 at any given time. While on duty, each guard wears a
  tunic that bears the Lords’ Alliance emblem: a gold crown on a red field.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Prisoners.</strong> All prisoners in Revel’s End are identified by a
  number. This simple protocol keeps prisoners on an equal footing. Prison
  personnel commit these numbers to memory, and the records of all
  prisoners—past and present—are stored in area R22. Each inmate wears a uniform
  that consists of a hoodless robe without pockets, leather slippers without
  laces, and cloth undergarments. While outside their cells, prisoners wear
  manacles on their wrists and ankles. While manacled, a prisoner’s walking
  speed can’t exceed 10 feet.

<h2 id="r1-dock">R1: Dock</h2>
<p>Ships dock here to offload prisoners and supplies.</p>
<h2 id="r2-elevator">R2: Elevator</h2>
<p>
  A sturdy wooden scaffold clings to the 160-foot-high cliff separating the
  prison from the dock. Looming above the scaffolding is a wooden crane that is
  controlled from area R3. The crane raises and lowers an elevator car that has
  a retractable wooden gate on the side opposite the crane. The elevator car is
  a hollow wooden cube measuring 10 feet on each side. It takes 1 minute for the
  car to travel all the way up or down the scaffold.
</p>
<h2 id="r3-guard-rooms">R3: Guard Rooms</h2>
<em>
  This room contains a table with four chairs, and a cabinet holding whetstones
  and other simple supplies for repairing armor and weapons.
</em>
<p>
  Three guards (<a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Veteran.png"
    >veteran</a
  >s) are stationed in each of these two rooms. The guards pass the time by
  playing cards, sharpening their weapons, and complaining about the weather.
</p>
<p>
  Embedded in the north wall of the northern guard room is an iron lever that
  raises and lowers the elevator in area R2. During a patrol, two of the guards
  leave the room to make their rounds for 4 minutes.
</p>
<h2 id="r4-hospital">R4: Hospital</h2>
<p>
  <em
    >This chamber contains a dozen simple beds. Cabinets along the north wall
    hold medical supplies.</em
  >
</p>
<p>
  The cabinets hold enough supplies to assemble twenty healer’s kits, five vials
  of antitoxin, and various other medicines and tinctures.
</p>
<p>
  Some of these substances are poisonous if ingested in the wrong proportion. A
  character proficient with alchemist’s supplies, a poisoner’s kit, an
  herbalist’s kit, or the Medicine skill can identify the tinctures and combine
  them into an ingested poison. A creature that ingests the poison must make a
  DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it takes 10 (3d6)
  poison damage and becomes poisoned for 1 hour. On a successful saving throw,
  it takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned. In either case, the creature
  has painful stomach cramps until it finishes a short rest, drinks a vial of
  antitoxin, or is targeted by an effect that ends the poisoned condition. If a
  prisoner suffers these cramps, the guards bring the prisoner to the hospital
  to be examined and treated. Characters disguised as guards can volunteer for
  or be assigned that duty.
</p>
<h2 id="r5-stables">R5: Stables</h2>
<p>
  Visitors who bring mounts, sled dogs, pack animals, or pets to Revel’s End can
  keep their animals here. The prison doesn’t supply food for animals, however.
</p>
<h2 id="r6-mess-hall">R6: Mess Hall</h2>
<p>
  Prison personnel dine here. Tables and benches fill the room, and dishes and
  dulled cutlery are stored in cabinets along the south wall. The mess hall
  serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The characters can meet here without
  arousing any suspicion.
</p>
<h2 id="r7-councilors-quarters">R7: Councilors’ Quarters</h2>
<p>
  These ten rooms are furnished identically. Each contains a bed, a desk with
  matching chair, a claw-footed chest, and wall hooks for hanging clothes. The
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Continual Flame.png"
    >continual flame</a
  >
  spell that illuminates each room can be suppressed or returned to its normal
  light level by uttering the command word, “lights.”
</p>
<p>
  These rooms are set aside for the ten members of the Absolution Council,
  though only three rooms are currently in use. The other seven members of the
  council are absent, so the warden lets visitors use the spare rooms.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Council Members.</strong> These three members of the Absolution
  Council are at Revel’s End:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Councilor Voss Anderton.</strong> Voss represents the city of
  Neverwinter. He is a lawful neutral, human noncombatant who has a precise,
  lawyerly way of speaking. He never misses a council meeting or parole hearing.
  He votes with his head, not his heart, and he always weighs the ramifications
  of commuting a prisoner’s sentence.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Councilor Jil Torbo.</strong> Jil represents the city of Baldur’s
  Gate. She is a neutral, halfling noncombatant who loathes her job. She has no
  sense of humor and sighs deeply when her patience is tested. She likes giving
  others the benefit of the doubt, however—perhaps as an act of dissent—and
  votes yes on commutations more often than not.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Councilor Kriv Norixius.</strong> Kriv represents the town of
  Daggerford. He is a lawful good, dragonborn noncombatant of silver dragon
  ancestry. He hopes to impress the Duchess of Daggerford by doing a good job.
  He has no tolerance for unrepentant criminals and often votes no on
  commutations.
</p>
<h2 id="r8-kitchen-and-side-rooms">R8: Kitchen and Side Rooms</h2>
<p>
  Six cooks (neutral, human
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Commoner.png">commoners</a>)
  take shifts here, working in pairs to produce meals for the prisoners and
  staff. The kitchen contains everything one would expect to see, as well as an
  iron stove and a pump that draws water from a magically heated cistern on the
  roof. Off-duty cooks sleep in the largest of the three rooms west of the
  kitchen. This side room is lit by
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Continual Flame.png"
    >continual flame</a
  >
  spells that can be suppressed or activated by uttering the command word,
  “lights.” The middle side room—not heated, unlike the rest of the prison—is
  used for cold storage. The smallest side room is a well-stocked pantry.
</p>
<h2 id="r9-guard-towers">R9: Guard Towers</h2>
<p>
  Each of these four triangular towers is two stories tall. A tower’s interior
  chamber is empty except for a wooden ladder that climbs to an iron hatch held
  shut by an
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Arcane Lock.png">arcane lock</a>
  spell (see the “Prison Features” section for more details). This hatch leads
  to the tower’s flat rooftop, which is lined with battlements. Three Lords’
  Alliance guards (<a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Veteran.png"
    >veteran</a
  >s) in cold-weather clothing are stationed on the roof of each tower.
</p>
<h2 id="r10-armory">R10: Armory</h2>
<p>
  <em
    >This room contains wooden racks and chests filled with weaponry. Floating
    in the middle of the room is a spherical creature with a large central eye
    and four writhing eyestalks.</em
  >
</p>
<p>
  The inventory is nonmagical and includes twenty halberds, fifteen longswords,
  fifteen shortswords, ten pikes, ten heavy crossbows, five light crossbows, and
  hundreds of crossbow bolts.
</p>
<p>
  The armory is guarded by a
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Spectator.png">spectator</a>
  that treats the weapons as treasure. It knows every member of the prison staff
  on sight. It won’t leave the room and attacks anyone it doesn’t recognize.
</p>
<p>
  Hatch. A wooden ladder leads to an iron hatch in the ceiling. An arcane lock
  spell seals the hatch (see the “Prison Features” section for more details),
  which opens onto the roof.
</p>
<h2 id="r11-courtyard">R11: Courtyard</h2>
<p>
  This courtyard is paved with flagstones, which are covered with drifting snow.
</p>
<p>
  When the weather allows, prisoners are brought here—individually or in small
  groups—for fresh air and exercise. They are watched closely by guards on the
  ground as well as the guards on the corner tower. Characters can speak quietly
  with a prisoner without being noticed from the tower.
</p>
<h2 id="r12-meeting-room">R12: Meeting Room</h2>
<p>
  This room holds a large, rectangular table with a single chair on one long
  side and three similar chairs on the opposite side. The room is used for
  meetings with prisoners or the warden.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hatch.</strong> A wooden ladder leads to an iron hatch in the ceiling
  that opens onto the roof. An
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Arcane Lock.png">arcane lock</a>
  spell seals the hatch (see the “Prison Features” section for more details).
</p>
<h2 id="r13-storeroom">R13: Storeroom</h2>
<p>
  Supplies are stored here in crates and other containers. At present, the
  prison has stockpiled enough necessities to continue operations for six
  months.
</p>
<h2 id="r14-privy">R14: Privy</h2>
<p>
  This room contains a dozen wooden waste buckets. Once per day, usually in the
  morning, manacled prisoners carry the buckets outside the prison and dispose
  of the waste while watched by guards.
</p>
<h2 id="r15-hexagon">R15: Hexagon</h2>
<p>
  This corridor allows guards and visitors to access the outermost rooms of the
  prison while avoiding the panopticon (area R16) and its prison cells (area
  R17). The guards refer to this corridor as “the hexagon” because of its shape.
</p>
<h2 id="r16-panopticon">R16: Panopticon</h2>
<p>
  <em
    >This hexagonal chamber is a large open space at the center of the prison.
    Cells line the chamber walls, and a smaller hexagonal room occupies the
    center of the space.</em
  >
</p>
<p>
  The
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Continual Flame.png"
    >continual flame</a
  >
  spells that light this area can be dimmed from the surveillance hub (area
  R18). The hall is dimly lit at night.
</p>
<h2 id="r17-cells">R17: Cells</h2>
<p>
  <em
    >Each cell is enclosed by formidable steel bars. Bolted to the back wall are
    iron bunk beds, each with a thin mattress. A waste bucket sits near the
    beds.</em
  >
</p>
<p>
  The prisoners are kept in these unlit cells (effectively illuminated by the
  lights in R16) behind barred gates that can be opened only from area R18. The
  gates are too secure to be forced open using brute strength or weapons, and
  magical attempts to open or bypass them are thwarted by permanent antimagic
  fields. Each field encompasses one cell and its gate. Spells and other magical
  effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in an
  antimagic field and can’t protrude into it. While an effect is suppressed, it
  doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its
  duration.
</p>
<p>
  Bolted to the back wall of each cell is an iron bunk bed with thin mattresses
  and a waste bucket nearby. Prisoners take their meals in their cells.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Prisoners.</strong> Each of the twenty-four cells can hold one or two
  prisoners. Roll 4d10 to determine the number of prisoners currently
  incarcerated at Revel’s End, give each one an identification number, and
  distribute them in the cells as you see fit. Numbers are assigned in the order
  in which the prisoners arrive and are never reused. The longest-serving
  prisoner currently incarcerated at Revel’s End is Prisoner 6, and the newest
  one is Prisoner 299. Prisoner 13 (see the “Roleplaying Prisoner 13” section
  later in this adventure for more details) has no cellmate. Her cell is marked
  on map 4.1.
</p>
<p>
  To add detail to other inmates, roll on the Prisoners table or choose entries
  you like. If a prisoner’s game statistics become necessary, choose an
  appropriate stat block from the Monster Manual, and remove armor, weapons, and
  other gear.

  staircase. The other guards watch the prisoners through 4-foot-tall,
  1-foot-wide arrow slits in the walls. Hanging on the walls between the arrow
  slits are fifty sets of iron manacles guards use to bind prisoners’ wrists and
  ankles.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Console.</strong> The console is a magical device that resembles a
  desk with a slanted top and is bolted to the floor. It is a Large object with
  AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The console
  has the following magical properties, which are disabled if it is reduced to 0
  hit points:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Gate Control.</strong> Twenty-four switches on the console open and

  and weapons within easy reach. They keep other belongings in unlocked
  footlockers tucked under their bunk beds.

  The floor of this room is 120 feet above the prison roof. A spiral staircase
  connects the room to the other levels of the tower (area R18 is 140 feet down,
  area R19 is 20 feet down, and area R23 is 20 feet up). Narrow windows line the
  outer walls.

  this room in manacles and given a chance to sway the council members before
  votes are cast. The warden (see area R21), who always attends such meetings,

</p>
<p>
  <strong>Prison Warden.</strong> The calm and unflappable warden of Revel’s End
  is Marta Marthannis, a lawful good, human mage who speaks Common, Draconic,
  Dwarvish, and Orc. She wears a red robe with gold trim and keeps a ring with
  seven tiny keys hanging from it in one pocket. One key unlocks the warden’s
  chest (see “Treasure” below); the others unlock the desk drawer and the
  cabinets in the warden’s office (area R22).
</p>
<p>
  Warden Marthannis is secretly a member of the Harpers, a faction that works
  behind the scenes to keep power out of the hands of evildoers. In her current
  position, she works to keep some of the Sword Coast’s worst malefactors behind
  bars. So far, the warden has managed to conceal her Harper affiliation from
  everyone else in the prison.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Marthannis’s Possession.</strong> Unlike her membership in the
  Harpers, Marthannis hasn’t concealed the fact that she is periodically
  possessed. Lodged inside her is the spirit of a deceased adventuring
  companion: a lawful good, shield tiefling fighter named Vlax Brawnanvil. The
  spirit of Vlax takes control of Warden Marthannis once or twice a day, each
  time for an hour or two—though never while she’s performing important duties,
  such as supervising prisoner meetings with visitors.
</p>
<p>
  While under Vlax’s control, the warden can’t cast her prepared spells or use
  the command word for high alert (see the “High Alert“ section), speaks only
  Dwarvish, and occasionally indulges Vlax’s vice for ale and spirits.
</p>
<p>
  Warden Marthannis knows that to rid herself of Vlax’s spirit, she must visit
  the Brawnanvil crypts in Gauntlgrym, a dwarven fortress under Mount Hotenow
  (near Neverwinter), where the spirits of Vlax’s kin can persuade Vlax to join
  them in the afterlife. The warden refuses to make the journey, however,
  because she can’t bear to lose all contact with Vlax. The warden has made her
  state known to the prison guards and Absolution Council members, and they have
  grown accustomed to her personality changes and bouts of revelry. The
  possession hasn’t affected the warden’s ability to carry out her duties, and
  so far, no one has questioned her fitness for her job.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Treasure.</strong> Among the chamber’s furnishings is a locked wooden
  chest, for which the warden carries the only key. A character using thieves’
  tools can use an action to try to pick the lock, doing so with a successful DC
  20 Dexterity check.
</p>
<p>
  The chest holds a set of calligrapher’s supplies, a sack containing 750 gp
  (money that’s used mainly to pay ship captains who drop off prisoners and
  cargo), and a silver cloak pin (25 gp) bearing the symbol of the Harpers: a
  tiny harp nestled between the horns of a crescent moon.
</p>
<p>
  Any character who searches the chest for secret compartments finds one in the
  lid. It holds a wand of binding that the warden keeps for emergencies.
</p>
<h2 id="r22-office">R22: Office</h2>
<p>
  <em>
    A heavy desk stands in the middle of the room with parchment, quills, and
    ink at the ready. Five heavy wood cabinets line the east wall.</em
  >
</p>
<p>
  Prison records are stored here in the locked cabinets. The cabinets also
  contain ship cargo manifests and records of past deliveries, as well as
  prisoner transfer orders and a ledger documenting the names, crimes,
  sentences, and commutations of every prisoner who has been incarcerated at
  Revel’s End. The records include death certificates for prisoners who died
  while incarcerated. The cause of death is always given as “natural,”
  “accidental,” or “unnatural,” with no details.
</p>
<p>
  A desk in the middle of the room has ten financial ledgers packed into a
  locked side drawer. The keys for the desk and the cabinets are in the warden’s
  possession. A character with thieves’ tools can use an action to try to pick
  the lock on the desk drawer or one of the cabinets, doing so with a successful
  DC 12 Dexterity check.
</p>
<h2 id="r23-tower-roof">R23: Tower Roof</h2>
<p>
  This flat rooftop is 140 feet above the prison roof and 300 feet above sea
  level. Three 6-foot-high walls to the north, southwest, and southeast provide
  limited cover, but much of the rooftop is exposed to the elements.
</p>
<p>
  A wooden drawbridge can be lowered on one side to create an airship dock. An
  action is required to raise or lower the drawbridge.
</p>
<p>
  No guards are stationed here. If the guards in the prison watchtowers (area
  R9) see an airship or an airborne threat approaching Revel’s End, they alert
  the rest of the prison. The warden then dons cold-weather clothing and heads
  to the roof to greet the airship crew or deal with the airborne threat
  herself.
</p>
<h1 id="getting-inside">Getting Inside</h1>
<p>
  If the characters use the cover Varrin provided, their ship arrives at Revel’s
  End just before dawn, three days after leaving Gullet Cove. The characters are
  directed off the ship, ride the elevator to the cliff top, and are admitted
  through the front doors. Characters posing as guards are taken to the barracks
  (area R19), where they meet with head guard Yula Dargeria, a no-nonsense
  stickler for the prison’s rules. Characters posing as cooks are delivered to
  the kitchen (area R8), where they report to Chef Tiny Toulaine, a hulking,
  jovial man who carries an enormous saucepan instead of a heavy crossbow. Small
  characters who stowed away in supply crates are taken to either the storeroom
  (area R13), the kitchen’s cold storage room (the middle room off area R8), or
  the pantry (the northernmost room off area R8). If more than one Small
  character stows away, pick one location where they’re all delivered.
</p>
<p>
  Characters who bang on the prison’s north or south door are admitted into a
  30-foot-long corridor, where they are greeted by the three guards from a
  nearby guard room (area R3). These guards insist on confiscating the
  characters’ weapons and storing them in a nearby lockbox. In addition, one
  guard searches each character for concealed weapons. A character can conceal a
  dagger or similarly sized weapon from a guard’s notice with a successful DC 13
  Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.
</p>
<p>
  If the characters have sled dogs or pack animals, a guard grants the party
  access to the stables (area R5), where the animals can be kept safe. Animals
  aren’t allowed in the prison otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  After relinquishing their weapons and securing their animals, the characters
  are escorted by one of the guards to the meeting room (area R12), where they
  must wait one hour for the warden to greet them. During this time, the
  characters are unattended and can attempt to sneak into the prison at large.
  Doing so without alerting the guards requires a successful DC 13 Dexterity
  (Stealth) check. Recovering the characters’ weapons from the lockbox requires
  a successful DC 16 Dexterity check with thieves’ tools. If the characters are
  caught attempting either of these tasks, the guards return them to the meeting
  room and wait with them for the warden, who throws them out unless they
  provide a satisfactory reason for their visit and subterfuge.
</p>
<p>
  The warden only accepts the characters’ presence if they are seeking shelter.
  In that case, she grants them temporary accommodations (in area R7) for up to
  two days and two nights, and the characters receive three meals a day during
  their stay. If the characters fail to provide a satisfactory reason for their
  visit, the warden has their weapons and animals returned to them before
  throwing them out.
</p>
<h2 id="extreme-cold">Extreme Cold</h2>
<p>
  The temperature outside is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (−18 degrees
  Celsius) while the characters are at the prison. A creature exposed to the
  cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour
  or gain 1 level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold
  damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing
  cold-weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally
  adapted to cold climates.
</p>
<h2 id="guards-on-watch">Guards on Watch</h2>
<p>
  The prison has four guard towers (see area R9), and three guards in
  cold-weather clothing are stationed atop each one. If you need to make Wisdom
  (Perception) checks for the guards to determine if they notice something, make
  only one roll with advantage.
</p>
<p>
  If the guards on a tower see or hear something out of the ordinary—such as an
  approaching ship, a group of visitors, or a monster flying overhead—one guard
  descends into the tower to alert the rest of the prison while the others stay
  at their posts.
</p>

<h2 id="suspicion">Suspicion</h2>
<p>
  Activities outside the daily routine of the prison draw attention from the
  guards and what few other staff members there are. Suspicion is measured in
  levels from 1 to 6. When the characters arrive at the prison, the suspicion
  level is 1.
</p>
<p>
  Suspicion can increase when prison staff members witness or find evidence of
  behavior outside the norm. Circumstances that increase the suspicion level
  include the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using a prisoner’s real name while in the guise of prison staff</li>
  <li>Getting caught by a patrol (see Patrol Routes)</li>
  <li>
    Casting a spell that has perceptible components or effects in sight of a
    guard
  </li>
  <li>
    Conversing with a prisoner about anything other than prison business (such
    as giving them instructions for tasks)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For suspicion to increase, prison staff members must witness the characters
  performing unusual activity, and any witnesses must report their observations.
  If the characters can convince the witness what they saw was justified, the
  suspicion level doesn’t increase.
</p>
<h2 id="distractions">Distractions</h2>
<p>
  A character can create a distraction, giving themself or an ally time to
  undertake a suspicious activity without being witnessed. If the distracting
  character succeeds on a Charisma (Deception) check against a DC set by the
  current suspicion level (see the Suspicion table), the suspicious activity
  goes unnoticed. Use your discretion to decide if any given activity is subtle
  enough to be covered by a distraction. For example, a glib conversation can’t
  cover up an explosion.
</p>
<h2 id="effects-of-suspicion">Effects of Suspicion</h2>
<p>
  As the suspicion level increases, patrols become more frequent, and the prison
  staff become increasingly vigilant. At suspicion level 6, the warden puts the
  prison on high alert.

  <strong>Level.</strong> The current suspicion level is reduced by 1 (to a
  minimum of 1) every 8 hours if the prison staff detects no suspicious activity
  during that time.

  when characters enter the patrol route to see if they encounter a guard patrol
  (see “Patrol Routes”).

</p>
<h2 id="high-alert">High Alert</h2>
<p>
  When a matter of concern is brought to her attention, the warden (see area
  R21) decides whether to place the prison on high alert. Circumstances that
  warrant taking such action include a prisoner revolt, an escape, the approach
  of an unfamiliar ship, a dragon sighting, an attack, discovering a dead body,
  or suspicious activity (see “Suspicion” above).
</p>
<p>
  By speaking the command word, “maristo,” the warden—and only the warden—can
  place the prison on high alert (or speak it again to end the high alert), with
  the following effects:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>High-Alert Signals.</strong> For 1 minute, a warning horn blares
  throughout the prison, and all light created by
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Continual Flame.png"
    >continual flame</a
  >
  spells in the prison takes on a reddish hue.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Prison Deployment.</strong> The guards in area R19 don their armor,
  arm themselves, and move to area R18. The warden does the same and commands
  the garrison from there. Members of the Absolution Council retreat to area
  R20.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>See Invisibility.</strong> The warden and all prison guards gain the
  benefit of a
  <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/See Invisibility.png"
    >see invisibility</a
  >
  spell.
</p>
<h2 id="patrol-routes">Patrol Routes</h2>
<p>
  Guards regularly patrol in pairs from the guard rooms (area R3, alternating
  which room for each patrol) around the hexagon (area R15), with short checks
  into the courtyard (area R11) and the armory (area R10). The route is marked
  in yellow on the players’ map of Revel’s End. It normally takes 4 minutes for
  a patrol to make its round and return to its post.
</p>
<p>
  When one or more characters enter an area marked on the patrol route, roll a
  die. The size of the die rolled is determined by the current suspicion level
  of the prison, as indicated on the Suspicion table. On a 1, the characters
  encounter a patrol. Ask the players how their characters react, and give them
  1 round of actions. The characters can try to slip away if there is a nearby
  exit or corner to duck around by making a group Dexterity (Stealth) check or
  try to blend in by making a group Charisma (Deception) check. Each check is
  made against a DC set by the current suspicion level. On a failure, the patrol
  notices the characters, who must account for their presence.
</p>
<p>
  If the characters try to talk their way past a patrol, have one of the
  characters make a Charisma check using Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion,
  depending on their story, against a DC set by the suspicion level. If other
  characters support the story, the check is made with advantage. On a success,
  the patrol lets them go. On a failure, the patrol escorts the characters to a
  guard room (area R3), where the guard interrogates the characters about the
  characters’ presence in a prohibited area. If the characters have a cover
  story for being in the prison, the guards escort them to where they should be:
  the kitchen staff’s quarters (the largest side room off area R8) or the
  barracks (area R19) in the case of off-duty guards. The suspicion level then
  increases by 1.
</p>
<p>
  Once the characters encounter a patrol, don’t check for another patrol when
  the characters enter the route until 20 minutes have passed.
</p>
