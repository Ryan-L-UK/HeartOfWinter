    <p>
      This magical tome appears to contain several spell scrolls. Each scroll
      can be used once per day, and regenerates daily at dawn. In reality, the
      spells are inscribed wrong, and their effects vary wildly from the
      intended. When one of these scrolls are used the DM reveals the spell's
      true effect.

          <strong>Fireball / Friarball.</strong> Conjures and launches a
          clergyman at the target, dealing 8d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed
          Dexterity saving throw. The conjured friar is holding its knees and
          tumbles end over end while screaming religious platitudes during its
          flight, and lies still after hitting the target. It is a nonliving
          magical construct, and upon closer inspection, it appears to be made
          of painted wood and dyed cloth. </em

        <em>
          <strong>Ice Storm / Ick Storm.</strong> Gross sludge rains down for
          one minute creating difficult terrain in a 20 foot radius. </em

          fish, enclosed in pastry or rolled in breadcrumbs. </em

        <em>

          can communicate telepathically with your father, regardless of whether
          they are dead or alive. </em

          three times. On a result of 1, the clothes are common quality. On a
          result of 2-10, the clothes are traveler's quality. On a result of
          11-15, the clothes are costume quality, on a result of 16-19, the
          clothes are fine quality. On a result of 20, the clothes are a magic
