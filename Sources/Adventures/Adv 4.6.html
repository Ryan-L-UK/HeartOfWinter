      Every year, the Awakening Festival draws folk from across the Moonshae
      Isles, uniting celebrants as they tell their history in song and set the
      course for the upcoming year. But the mood turns grim when a group of
      farmers suddenly turns violent, manipulated by an unknown magical malady.
      In the aftermath, well-known trader
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
        >Aunt Dellie</a
      >
      fears for her goddaughter
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>, a
      worker at the farm the attackers came from, deep within the outlying
      farmlands known as Ulgoth's Beard. When the characters investigate, they
      are pitted against a lurking evil that uses a young woman's grief and
      loneliness to lure new victims.
    </p>
    <h1 id="part-1-starting-the-adventure">Part 1: Starting the Adventure</h1>
    <p>
      The adventure begins following the characters downtime, they have elected
      to meet this morning and they may wish to share stories of their downtime.
      Today is the start of the Awakening Festive, A Day to celebrate a
      retelling of the land of Faerûn history, with a focus on the animal
      awakenings.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        You all awaken this morning having had 15 days to yourself. You agreed
        to meet today as it is the first of a multiday event called the
        'Awakening Festival'. This festival is only generally celebrated on
        Moonshae Isles, although a small number of folks on the mainland have
        been known to recognise the days significance. This annual celebration
        is marked by the multiday <em>Awakening Song</em>, a communal retelling
        of the land's history and a memorial to those who've passed on. Drawing
        particular attention to the history of awakened animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        You meet this morning in Waukeen's Promenade, where preparations are
        very much already underway. The streets are alive with vibrant music. As
        the history of the land is recounted through song, with a variety of
        musicians and bards coming together to form impromptu bands. Their
        performances blend together as passers-by join in during choruses, which
        gives a true sense of collective celebration.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Anyone on the streets of Gullet Cove during the Awakening Festival hears
      what the locals call the <em>Awakening Song</em>, a collection of songs
      recounting local histories. Characters who spend an hour exploring the
      festival learn much about the history of the land. They also have
      advantage on Intelligence (History) checks related to the
      <em>Awakening Song</em> made for the rest of the adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the festival, stalls throughout the community sell local crafts,
      (cheap) musical instruments, and street foods. Small straw dolls wearing
      colourful shirts and dresses are widely available for 5 cp each. A doll
      can be made to resemble the buyer for 7 cp. The dolls are a popular local
      craft and nothing more.

    <p>
      After the characters have engaged with the local festival as much as they
      please, the character who has the highest passive Wisdom (Perception)
      score notices a group of celebrants acting strangely. Read or paraphrase
      the following:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As part of the crowd begins another verse of the
        <em>Awakening Song</em>, four what appear to be farmers begin to walk
        into the area, however rather than singing, they stare blankly. A few
        moments go by before they surge forward into the celebrants, raising
        rusty farming implements.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Four farmers attack the festival-goers. They use the
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Cultist.png">Cultist</a>
      stat block; their rusty, bladed farming implements have the same
      statistics as scimitars. Any character who engages the farmers sees their
      eyes swirl with crimson, resembling bloody, unshed teardrops. Characters
      have no way of knowing it yet, but this is a mark of the soul shaker's
      control (see the &quot;Soul Shaker&quot; section at the end of this
      adventure).
    </p>
    <p>
      The festival-goers closest to the strange farmers panic and flee. Unless
      the characters do the same, the attackers target them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one local holds their ground: a surprised woman named
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
        >Aunt Dellie</a
      >
      (<a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Commoner.png"
        >commoner</a
      >). She clearly recognizes some of the strange farmers and tries to reason
      with them to no avail.
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
        >Aunt Dellie</a
      >
      shouts for the characters not to kill the farmers, noting that they're not
      behaving like themselves.
    </p>
    <h2 id="memories-of-death">Memories of Death</h2>
    <p>
      When the last
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Farmer.png">Farmer</a> is
      defeated, locals return to tend to the wounded. The farmers are known to
      many in the crowd, prompting confusion over their strange appearance and
      what caused them to attack. Talk of curses begins to spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Investigating the Farmers.</em></strong> A character who
      fought the farmers or examines them afterward can make a DC 13
      Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check. On a success, the character can
      tell the farmers are being magically controlled. Spells like
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Detect Magic.png"
        >Detect Magic</a
      >
      also reveal that the farmers are surrounded by an aura of enchantment
      magic. While this magic—the effects of the soul shaker's
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Geas.png">Geas</a>
      spell—lingers, the farmers' eyes keep their crimson hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the farmers are healed or roused from unconsciousness, they refuse to
      speak. They don't attack again, but the locals keep them restrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The characters likely don't have the resources to remove the enchantment
      affecting the farmers yet—only destroying the soul shaker or waiting
      approximately a month can do this. Even if the characters do remove the
      effect, the farmers are confused and remember nothing helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Strange Parchment.</em></strong> As the characters investigate
      the situation,
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
        >Aunt Dellie</a
      >
      notices that one of the farmers was clutching a crumpled sheet of
      parchment. She opens it, and nearby characters hear her curse in concerned
      shock.
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
        >Aunt Dellie</a
      >
      hands the crumpled parchment to any character who asks about it. It bears
      a charcoal sketch of a child struggling to swim in dark water while being
      grasped at by hands beneath the surface.
    </p>
    <h2 id="a-godmothers-fear">A Godmother's Fear</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
        >Aunt Dellie</a
      >
      clearly recognizes the sketch on the parchment one of the strange farmers
      had with them. Her strong voice shakes as she explains its significance:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The sketch was drawn by
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
          >Aunt Dellie</a
        >'s goddaughter,
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>.
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
          >Aunt Dellie</a
        >
        knows her art style, and this is a scene she draws regularly.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a child,
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
        saw her friend Culley drown in Cradlelace Lake while they were playing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since Culley's death,
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
        has used art to work through the sadness and guilt she carries to this
        day.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
        is currently working a farm in Ulgoth's Beard, a half-day's travel from
        Gullet Cove. She was due to return to town for the Awakening Festival,
        but
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
          >Aunt Dellie</a
        >
        hasn't seen her yet.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Characters who investigate further and ask those nearby about the attack
      learn that the strange farmers all worked in Ulgoth's Beard, a dangerous
      but fertile farming region haunted by deadly predators.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the locals speculate about the fates of other farmers in Ulgoth's
      Beard,
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
        >Aunt Dellie</a
      >
      has no patience for debates on what to do next.
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
        >Aunt Dellie</a
      >
      implores the characters to go to Ulgoth's Beard where
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
      was working and make sure her goddaughter is safe, while she stays in
      Gullet Cove to organize a larger investigation. She offers the party 100
      gp to undertake this mission, and 100 gp more if the characters return her
      goddaughter to Gullet Cove safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
        >Aunt Dellie</a
      >
      gives the characters directions to Ulgoth's Beard, but she doesn't know
      exactly where
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>'s
      farm is. The characters must search for it once they reach Ulgoth's Beard.
    </p>
    <h1 id="part-2-to-ulgoths-beard">Part 2: To Ulgoth's Beard</h1>
    <p>
      The farm
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
      works at is 12 miles from Gullet Cove. Whether the characters are
      traveling by foot or using a wagon, at a normal pace it takes half a day
      to reach Ulgoth's Beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the characters are underway, read or paraphrase the following to
      summarize the journey:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The journey from Gullet Cove leads south through an area known as the
        Ribbon, where clustered farmhouses dot the ground on the edge of Dernal
        Forest. Eventually, the road dwindles to little more than a track. The
        trees grow denser and the farms fewer and farther between as you near
        the lands called Ulgoth's Beard. Ulgoth’s Beard sits in a region known
        as Alaron on the southern edge of the island.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check notices
      that many of the farms in the Ribbon are touched by blight and the animals
      are thin. A basic understanding of the region will easy explain that
      agriculture in the region has been deteriorating for years, forcing locals
      to farm Ulgoth's Beard despite its dangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the characters stop at any of the farms they pass in the Ribbon, they
      see no sign of danger, but no one at the farms knows
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="last-stop">Last Stop</h2>
    <p>
      As the characters push into Ulgoth's Beard, they near a weathered farm
      surrounded by crops that look healthier than those they saw in the Ribbon.
      Not everything about the farm is hopeful, though:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Growls and excited yipping resound from the field surrounding a nearby
        farm. The source isn't clear, but from the motion of the tall crops,
        something moves swiftly through the fields parallel to the road.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check realizes two
      groups are moving through the fields, one in pursuit of the other, though
      the dense crops block their view. Characters who enter the fields find
      visibility reduced to 10 feet. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom
      (Survival) check finds the trail of whatever just moved through the fields
      and can easily follow it.
    </p>
    <h3 id="savage-scavengers">Savage Scavengers</h3>
    <p>
      If the characters follow the movement through the field, they come to a
      clearing and see an old
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Farmer.png">Farmer</a>
      fleeing three horse-sized coyotes. The
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Farmer.png">Farmer</a> is
      about 30 feet ahead of the coyotes. If the characters didn't enter the
      fields, a moment later, an old man stumbles from amid the crops and falls
      into the road. Three massive coyotes are soon upon him. In either case,
      the old man has no hope of defending himself against the creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massive coyotes are a persistent threat in Ulgoth's Beard. The three
      coyotes use the
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Dire Wolf.png"
        >Dire Wolf</a
      >
      stat block, while the
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Farmer.png">Farmer</a>
      they pursue is a
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Commoner.png">commoner</a
      >. A coyote flees if reduced to 10 hit points or fewer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the fighting ends, the
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Farmer.png">Farmer</a> is
      bloodied but angrier at the animals than scared. He thanks the characters
      and introduces himself as Uncle Polder.
    </p>
    <h3 id="life-in-ulgoths-beard">Life in Ulgoth's Beard</h3>
    <p>
      Following the battle, Uncle Polder thanks the characters and asks what
      brings them out this way. He invites them to water their horses and
      refresh themselves, gesturing to his nearby farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Polder's house is typical of farmhouses in the Ribbon and Ulgoth's
      Beard, a wood-frame, single-story building with a large porch, bounded by
      trees. The other farmhouses in the surrounding part of Ulgoth's Beard are
      all part of the same pact, a communal collection of farms whose
      inhabitants live, work, and share with each other. Uncle Polder's
      farmhouse is one of the largest in the group, suggesting his importance to
      the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Polder is glad to answer any questions the characters have about the
      area. Use the following points to guide the conversation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There's always trouble in Ulgoth's Beard, but Uncle Polder can't recall
        any unusual problems this season.
      </li>
      <li>
        He's met
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
        and knows the farm she works at, though it's part of another pact. It's
        not far from Uncle Polder's, but people in Ulgoth's Beard mostly stick
        close to home. The farmers of the two pacts don't interact often.
      </li>
      <li>
        Uncle Polder recalls helping
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a
        >'s pact set up early in the season. He keeps an eye out for people who
        might not be a good fit for life in Ulgoth's Beard, and
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
        seemed to have things on her mind other than farming.
      </li>
      <li>
        When
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
        and others of her pact came to Uncle Polder's pact a couple weeks ago to
        trade for tools, she seemed to be embracing life in Ulgoth's Beard. She
        spoke of how happy she was that someone named Culley was coming to join
        her soon. Uncle Polder assumed Culley was another worker coming late to
        the farm.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      From their conversation with
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
        >Aunt Dellie</a
      >, the characters remember that Culley was
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>'s
      friend who drowned many years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      If told the truth about Culley, Uncle Polder is surprised;
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
      spoke as if Culley were a close and current friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Polder allows the characters to rest at his home as long as they
      please. When they're ready to go, he gives them detailed directions to the
      farm
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
      works at a few miles away.
    </p>

      width="100%"
    />
    <p>
      As the characters continue on their journey, they notice the environment
      changing around them after only another hour of travel. After they've
      travelled about a mile from Uncle Polder's home, read or paraphrase the
      following description:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Moving south through the region you find the small settlement known as
        Ulgoth’s Beard. Despite being on the edge of the sea, the air here
        smells stagnant and carries the taste of metal. A small group of
        farmhouses hunch upon the edge of a patch of green fields.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Suddenly the ground begins to shake, causing the road ahead to ripple,
      suddenly below you a 10-foot-square, 10-foot-deep sinkhole to opens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw
      or fall 10 feet, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage. Characters who said
      they would be mindful of sinkholes or unstable ground after the previous
      tremor have advantage on this saving throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any creature at the bottom of the hole finds they're not alone. Four
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Crawling Claws.png"
        >Crawling Claws</a
      >
      scrabble free from the dirt at the bottom of the pit and attack any
      creatures within.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check realizes
      the tremor likely wasn't an earthquake but something local, such as a
      collapsing cave or something moving underground. Any character who
      examines the disembodied hands and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception)
      check can tell that the creatures were digging through the loose earth,
      though it's not clear to what end.
    </p>
    <h2 id="x-marks-the-spot">X Marks the Spot</h2>
    <p>
      The farming community
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a> is
      a part of isn't just one farm, but a cooperative of adjacent farms. As the
      characters reach the location Uncle Polder directed them to, they find six
      farmhouses, each in various states of disrepair.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the characters approach the nearest farm, they find the surrounding
      fields overgrown and the plants rotting. Crows flit between perches on the
      fences, but there are no signs of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly all the houses have been sloppily painted with a large and muddy
      red <em>X</em>. The interiors of these farmhouses are utilitarian,
      featuring only a few rooms for sleeping and a small kitchen. No creatures
      are within, and the accumulation of dust makes it clear no one's disturbed
      the rooms for some time. Every farmhouse bears a sign that something's
      wrong. Roll on the Farmhouse Conditions table for each building to
      determine what.

      A character who investigates at least two of the farmhouses can make a DC
      14 Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, they notice one farmhouse
      doesn't have a red <em>X</em> painted on it. This building is the
      farmhouse where
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
      resided, and it also serves as the pact's communal meeting house.

    <h1 id="part-4-kiannas-farmhouse">Part 4: Kianna's Farmhouse</h1>
    <p>
      A farmhouse near the center of the steading serves as a main kitchen,
      dining area, and meeting place for the smaller houses around it. This is
      the farmhouse where
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
      was a resident. As the characters approach, read or paraphrase the
      following description:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This large farmhouse appears abandoned like the smaller houses around
        it, but no <em>X</em> marks it. Farming implements lie abandoned in the
        mud, and wild plants have grown up to the house's faded wooden porch.
        The crops in the surrounding field appear sickly.

    <h3 id="f1-overgrown-yard">F1: Overgrown Yard</h3>
    <p>
      The house's yard is muddy red clay. Several rusty shovels and rakes lie
      scattered about.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Farming Implements.</em></strong> A character who looks around
      the back of the house sees a pitchfork stuck into the earth near the
      house's northeast corner. On further investigation, they see it's stuck
      through the severed hand of a young woman. The characters have no way of
      knowing this, but the hand was once a crawling claw and was dispatched by
      a <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Farmer.png">Farmer</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Sickly Crops.</em></strong> Wheat and corn struggle to grow in
      the fields surrounding the house. Any character who succeeds on a DC 14
      Intelligence (Nature) check can tell the plants around this farm are
      sickly because something's wrong with the soil. A character who succeeds
      on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check notices raised paths through the
      dirt, like mole tunnels, though no creatures are obvious. Although it's
      not evident, the soul shaker's evil and the excavations of the crawling
      claws have spoiled the land around the house.
    </p>
    <h3 id="f2-porch">F2: Porch</h3>
    <p>
      A large wooden porch wraps around the front and one side of the farmhouse.
      Its planks creak ominously when stepped on, but there is no danger here.
      Closed curtains shroud the windows, but the doors to the interior are
      unlocked and ajar. Both lead to a musty central hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Doors.</em></strong> The doors leading off the hallway are
      closed but not locked.
    </p>
    <h3 id="f3-living-room">F3: Living Room</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The furniture in this living room is haphazardly arranged and looks
        close to falling apart. Beneath, the floor is covered in hundreds of
        handprints painted using crimson mud.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The art style is similar to that of the picture
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
        >Aunt Dellie</a
      >
      found in Promise. Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom
      (Perception) check notices a break in the pattern under a chair. If the
      chair is moved, it reveals a muddy depiction of two children—one is
      reaching for the other, who is being dragged into the water by large
      hands. Scrapes in the muddy image form the name &quot;Culley.&quot;
    </p>
    <h3 id="f4-bedroom">F4: Bedroom</h3>
    <p>
      The bedroom holds a bed and writing desk for a single occupant. Most of
      the space is neat and orderly, but the desk is strewn with art supplies
      and scraps of paper bearing fragmented images.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Paintings.</em></strong> Any character who riffles through the
      paper on the desk finds repeating images of hands, lakes, and wide eyes
      looking up through water. The largest work shows a pair of eyes with
      handprints for pupils. All these images look similar in style to the
      picture
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
        >Aunt Dellie</a
      >
      found in Promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Chest.</em></strong> A small chest against the wall is
      unlocked and holds work clothes sized for a woman. A character who
      searches the chest and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation)
      check finds a pair of overalls with a pocket containing thirteen
      rings—plain rings, wedding bands, and formal jewelry sized for men and
      women—worth 2d10 gp each.
    </p>
    <h3 id="f5-dining-room">F5: Dining Room</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        A long plain table, a wooden sideboard, and several chairs lie shattered
        on the floor. The debris is streaked with crimson stains.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This dining room has been ransacked, and red mud covers the furnishings
      and floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character who approaches the table hears scratching coming from under
      it. Nothing is immediately visible beneath the table, but characters who
      investigate more closely find six
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Crawling Claws.png"
        >Crawling Claws</a
      >
      clinging to the underside. Once discovered, the monsters attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the crawling claws are dispatched, any character who searches the
      room thoroughly can make a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a
      successful check, the character finds several floorboards that have been
      pushed up from below, as though the crawling claws dug their way up
      through the loose soil beneath the house.
    </p>
    <h3 id="f6-kitchen">F6: Kitchen</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This kitchen has been torn apart. Pots and pans are scattered
        everywhere, and rotting food streaks the floorboards.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the center of the room, four enchanted farmers stand facing each other,
      their crimson eyes unblinking. Each holds a sharp knife or farming
      implement. They don't react when the characters enter or if they are
      touched or spoken to. They react only if harmed, stolen from, or commanded
      by the soul shaker. Each uses the
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Cultist.png">Cultist</a>
      stat block. Although the farmers are initially harmless, their appearance
      and lack of reaction are unnerving.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Pantry.</em></strong> The foodstuffs and supplies that once
      filled the pantry have been ransacked, and a large cupboard stands open. A
      trapdoor in the pantry's floor opens to reveal a 10-foot-tall ladder
      descending into a darkened cold-storage cellar. The stench of something
      rotting rises from below.

    <p>
      Shelves bearing root vegetables and other foodstuffs line the walls of
      this unfinished cellar. The south wall has partially collapsed, revealing
      a dark, narrow tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smell the characters noticed above is worse here, issuing from the
      tunnel. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or
      higher hear the faint sound of a woman singing farther down the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters who proceed 40 feet into the tunnel see a faint light emanating
      from around a bend.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Tunnel Song.</em></strong> As the characters move through the
      tunnel, the song's volume increases. The characters recognize this as part
      of the Awakening Song they overheard in Promise. This part of the song
      tells the story of a young man named Culley. Rather than its usual
      content, where the boy dies by drowning, the song has been sloppily
      rewritten to feature Culley being saved by his closest friend.
    </p>
    <h3 id="f8-cavern">F8: Cavern</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The tunnel opens into a lantern-lit, packed-dirt chamber, where the
        cause of the stench becomes apparent. A dozen bodies lie strewn across
        the floor, all wearing the clothes of farmers. Many of their limbs have
        been cleanly removed and set into a sizable pile on the far side of the
        cavern. In the centre of the room, a young woman is singing.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The bodies are the farmers missing from the surrounding farms, save for
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>.
      They've been killed and dismembered by the soul shaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Kianna.</em></strong> The young woman is
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
      (chaotic neutral, human
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Commoner.png">commoner</a
      >). She looks like she's in a dream state, and she holds a knife loosely,
      but her eyes aren't crimson like those of the other farmers.
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
      stops singing as soon as she notices the characters and says, &quot;Please
      go. You shouldn't be here.&quot; If the characters speak with
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>,
      she drifts between fearfully urging them to leave and coaxing them to stay
      and meet her friend, Culley, her mood and manner shifting erratically. Use
      the following points to guide the conversation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
        confirms she's the person the party seeks. She's saddened at any talk of
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
          >Aunt Dellie</a
        >
        having sent the characters to find her.
      </li>
      <li>
        She speaks brightly of how Culley finally came back to her after she
        lost him in Cradlelace Lake. It was so good to hear his voice again!
      </li>
      <li>
        When
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
        heard Culley's voice beyond the cellar, she dug and found this old
        cavern.
      </li>
      <li>
        Something happened to the farmers when they entered the caverns. After
        that they did whatever Culley said—including hurting one another and
        marking the houses with <em>X</em>'s to note who had visited the cellar.
      </li>
      <li>
        If asked about Culley,
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
        sadly says her friend drowned long ago—then cheerfully says he didn't
        drown because she saved him. He went away for a long while, but he came
        back.
      </li>
      <li>
        If asked where Culley is now,
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
        fearfully says he's sleeping after having fed. She believes her song
        helps keep him quiet, but she's tired.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As the characters speak with
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>, a
      character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check notices
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>'s
      eyes darting to the pile of limbs whenever she speaks brightly of Culley.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the characters ask
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a> to
      leave with them, she seems confused and scared, saying she can't. If she's
      coerced, or if a character investigates the pile of limbs, the soul shaker
      awakens.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Soul Shaker.</em></strong> When the characters try to leave
      the area or disturb the pile of limbs, the heap begins to move, revealing
      itself as an Undead made entirely of arms and hands. This is a
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Soul Shaker.png"
        >Soul Shaker</a
      >
      (detailed at the end of this adventure). This creature has a fraction of
      the memories of
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>'s
      friend Culley, but the horror has perverted those thoughts, seeking to
      control
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>,
      manipulate her guilt, and use her to lure other victims into its lair.
      When it reveals itself, the soul shaker targets a character with its
      telepathy, whispering things like &quot;Come play with us!&quot;,
      &quot;Are you lonely?&quot;, and &quot;Be with us forever!&quot; as it
      attacks. It might also relate snippets from the &quot;Fractured Soul&quot;
      section of the adventure's background.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the soul shaker awakens, if the farmers the soul shaker
      controls are still in area F6, it summons them to aid it. The four farmers
      (use the
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Cultist.png">Cultist</a>
      stat block) arrive in 2 rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a> is
      confused and terrified, and she stays out of the battle.

      Once the soul shaker is defeated, its grip on the farm's residents’ fades.

    <p>
      After the soul shaker is destroyed,
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
      collapses into unconsciousness. A character who examines her and succeeds
      on a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check can tell
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a> is
      sleep deprived and has been tormented by the strange creature. She wakes
      after an hour, unable to remember anything that's happened in recent days
      except for glimpses of strange hands and menacing words spoken in her dead
      friend Culley's voice.
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
      shares that she blames herself for Culley's death at Cradlelace Lake, and
      when she heard his voice, she thought the gods might be giving her a
      chance to make amends. Now she just wants to return to Promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      If asked about or shown her paintings from areas F3 or F4, she has no
      memory of creating them, though they're clearly in her art style. A
      character who succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom (Insight or Medicine) check
      recognizes
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a> is
      no longer suffering any supernatural effects, but the character also
      suspects her experiences might have affected her more deeply than she
      realizes.

    <p>
      If any of the farmers survived, the crimson hue vanishes from their eyes
      after the soul shaker's destruction, and they thank the characters for
      saving them. Even if the farmers in the house didn't survive, one or two
      lost in the fields arrive at the farmhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmers remember only snippets from the last few days, and the last
      thing they recall clearly is preparing to return to Gullet Cove for the
      Awakening Festival. They also share that
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a>
      had been behaving strangely, growing increasingly convinced that her dead
      friend was speaking to her. The farmers can also relate details from the
      adventure's background or about Cradlelace Lake if asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the farmers can't reward the characters with much in the way of
      wealth, seeing as they haven’t been able to farm for a long time. They do
      offer the party at small piece of advice. Be wary of the town guard in
      Gullet Cove. Those of the golden collar cannot be trusted, they forced us
      further south, rather than offer help.

    <p>
      When the characters return to Gullet Cover,
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
        >Aunt Dellie</a
      >
      is overjoyed if
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png">Kianna</a> is
      safe and tearful if her goddaughter met a bitter end. Either way, she's
      grateful to the characters for uncovering the truth and ending the soul
      shaker's threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving back at Gullet Cove the festivities have resumed. It would seem
      that once the character defeated the soul shaker, the enchanted farmers
      have regained all their awareness.

      rewards the characters with her promised payment and ensures that the
      first few rounds of drinks that night are on her. The farmer whose knees
      were shattered will also have regained his composure, but will be in
      unbearable pain.
