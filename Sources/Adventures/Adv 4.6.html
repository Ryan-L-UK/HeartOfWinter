      Every year, the Awakening Festival draws folk from across the Moonshae
      Isles, uniting celebrants as they tell their history in song and set the
      course for the upcoming year. But the mood turns grim when a group of
      farmers suddenly turns violent, manipulated by an unknown magical malady.
      In the aftermath, well-known trader

      >, a worker at the farm the attackers came from, deep within the outlying
      farmlands known as Ulgoth's Beard. When the characters investigate, they
      are pitted against a lurking evil that uses a young woman's grief and
      loneliness to lure new victims.
    </p>
    <h1 id="part-1-starting-the-adventure">Part 1: Starting the Adventure</h1>
    <p>
      The adventure begins following the characters downtime, they have elected
      to meet this morning and they may wish to share stories of their downtime.
      Today is the start of the Awakening Festive, A Day to celebrate a
      retelling of the land of Faer√ªn history, with a focus on the animal
      awakenings.
    </p>
    <em>
      You all awaken this morning having had 15 days to yourself. You agreed to
      meet today as it is the first of a multiday event called the 'Awakening
      Festival'. This festival is only generally celebrated on Moonshae Isles,
      although a small number of folks on the mainland have been known to
      recognise the days significance. This annual celebration is marked by the
      multiday Awakening Song, a communal retelling of the land's history and a
      memorial to those who've passed on. Drawing particular attention to the
      history of awakened animals.
      <p>
        You meet this morning in Waukeen's Promenade, where preparations are
        very much already underway. The streets are alive with vibrant music. As
        the history of the land is recounted through song, with a variety of
        musicians and bards coming together to form impromptu bands. Their
        performances blend together as passers-by join in during choruses, which
        gives a true sense of collective celebration.
      </p></em
    >
    <p>
      Anyone on the streets of Gullet Cove during the Awakening Festival hears
      what the locals call the Awakening Song, a collection of songs recounting
      local histories. Characters who spend an hour exploring the festival learn
      much about the history of the land. They also have advantage on
      Intelligence (History) checks related to the Awakening Song made for the
      rest of the adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the festival, stalls throughout the community sell local crafts,
      (cheap) musical instruments, and street foods. Small straw dolls wearing
      colourful shirts and dresses are widely available for 5 cp each. A doll
      can be made to resemble the buyer for 7 cp. The dolls are a popular local
      craft and nothing more.

    <p>
      After the characters have engaged with the local festival as much as they
      please, the character who has the highest passive Wisdom (Perception)
      score notices a group of celebrants acting strangely. Read or paraphrase
      the following:
    </p>
    <em
      ><p>
        As part of the crowd begins another verse of the Awakening Song, four
        what appear to be farmers begin to walk into the area, however rather
        than singing, they stare blankly. A few moments go by before they surge
        forward into the celebrants, raising rusty farming implements.
      </p></em

    <p>
      Four farmers attack the festival-goers. They use the
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Cultist.png"
          >Cultist</a
        ></strong
      >
      stat block; their rusty, bladed farming implements have the same
      statistics as scimitars. Any character who engages the farmers sees their
      eyes swirl with crimson, resembling bloody, unshed teardrops. Characters
      have no way of knowing it yet, but this is a mark of the soul shaker's
      control (see the &quot;
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Soul Shaker.png"
          >Soul Shaker</a
        ></strong
      >&quot; section at the end of this adventure).
    </p>
    <p>
      The festival-goers closest to the strange farmers panic and flee. Unless
      the characters do the same, the attackers target them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one local holds their ground: a surprised woman named
      <strong

          >commoners</a

      with them to no avail.
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
          >Aunt Dellie</a
        ></strong
      >
      shouts for the characters not to kill the farmers, noting that they're not
      behaving like themselves.
    </p>
    <h2 id="memories-of-death">Memories of Death</h2>
    <p>
      When the last
      <strong

          >Farmer</a
        ></strong
      >
      is defeated, locals return to tend to the wounded. The farmers are known
      to many in the crowd, prompting confusion over their strange appearance
      and what caused them to attack. Talk of curses begins to spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Investigating the Farmers.</strong> A character who fought the
      farmers or examines them afterward can make a DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana
      or Religion) check. On a success, the character can tell the farmers are
      being magically controlled. Spells like
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Detect Magic.png"
          >Detect Magic</a
        >
      </strong>
      also reveal that the farmers are surrounded by an aura of enchantment
      magic. While this magic (the effects of the soul shaker's
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Geas.png"
          >Geas</a
        ></strong
      >
      spell) lingers, the farmers' eyes keep their crimson hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the farmers are healed or roused from unconsciousness, they refuse to
      speak. They don't attack again, but the locals keep them restrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The characters likely don't have the resources to remove the enchantment
      affecting the farmers yet, only destroying the soul shaker or waiting
      approximately a month can do this. Even if the characters do remove the
      effect, the farmers are confused and remember nothing helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Strange Parchment.</strong> As the characters investigate the
      situation,
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
          >Aunt Dellie</a
        ></strong
      >
      notices that one of the farmers was clutching a crumpled sheet of
      parchment. She opens it, and nearby characters hear her curse in concerned
      shock.
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Aunt Dellie.png"
          >Aunt Dellie</a
        ></strong
      >
      hands the crumpled parchment to any character who asks about it. It bears
      a charcoal sketch of a child struggling to swim in dark water while being
      grasped at by hands beneath the surface.

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Characters who investigate further and ask those nearby about the attack
      learn that the strange farmers all worked in Ulgoth's Beard, a dangerous
      but fertile farming region haunted by deadly predators.
    </p>

      While the locals speculate about the fates of other farmers in Ulgoth's

          >Aunt Dellie</a

        A broad-shouldered woman wearing a multi-coloured dress that complements
        her dark skin approaches boldly, sizing you up from beneath a stylish

      was horrified by the attack, and she wants to make sure no other folk in
      Ulgoth's Beard are in danger. Characters who succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom
      (Insight) check recognize her motivations are not entirely altruistic. If
      pressed,

      admits she has made trade investments with several Ulgoth's Beard farms.
      She wants to ensure that no threats interfere with her getting first pick

      to accompany them, she tries to win them over by offering the use of her
      horses and a comfortable wagon. She remarks that if the characters are
      going to head into a mystery, they should be prepared to transport anyone
      who might have been harmed or afflicted.
    </p>

      If the characters choose not to travel with

    </p>
    <p>
      Once the characters are underway, read or paraphrase the following to
      summarize the journey:
    </p>
    <em
      ><p>
        The journey from Gullet Cove leads south through an area known as the
        Ribbon, where clustered farmhouses dot the ground on the edge of Dernal
        Forest. Eventually, the road dwindles to a track. The stands of trees
        grow denser and the farms fewer and farther between as you near the
        lands called Ulgoth's Beard. Urgoth's Beard sits in a region known as
        Alaron on the southern edge of the island.
      </p></em
    >
    <p>
      Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check notices
      that many of the farms in the Ribbon are touched by blight and the animals
      are thin.
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Lady Dre.png"
          >Lady Dre</a
        ></strong
      >
      can explain that agriculture in the region has been deteriorating for
      years, forcing locals to farm Ulgoth's Beard despite its dangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the characters stop at any of the farms they pass in the Ribbon, they
      see no sign of danger, but no one at the farms knows
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png"

      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="last-stop">Last Stop</h2>
    <p>
      As the characters push into Ulgoth's Beard, they near a weathered farm
      surrounded by crops that look healthier than those they saw in the Ribbon.
      Not everything about the farm is hopeful, though:
    </p>
    <em
      ><p>
        Growls and excited yipping resound from the field surrounding a nearby
        farm. The source isn't clear, but from the motion of the tall crops,
        something moves swiftly through the fields parallel to the road.
      </p></em
    >
    <p>
      A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check realizes two
      groups are moving through the fields, one in pursuit of the other, though
      the dense crops block their view. Characters who enter the fields find
      visibility reduced to 10 feet. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom
      (Survival) check finds the trail of whatever just moved through the fields
      and can easily follow it.

      characters and introduces himself as Uncle Polder.

    <h3 id="life-in-ulgoths-beard">Life in Ulgoth's Beard</h3>
    <p>
      Following the battle, Uncle Polder thanks the characters and asks what
      brings them out this way. He invites them to water their horses and
      refresh themselves, gesturing to his nearby farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Polder's house is typical of farmhouses in the Ribbon and Ulgoth's
      Beard, a wood-frame, single-story building with a large porch, bounded by
      trees. The other farmhouses in the surrounding part of Ulgoth's Beard are
      all part of the same pact, a communal collection of farms whose
      inhabitants live, work, and share with each other. Uncle Polder's
      farmhouse is one of the largest in the group, suggesting his importance to
      the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Polder is glad to answer any questions the characters have about the
      area. Use the following points to guide the conversation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There's always trouble in Ulgoth's Beard, but Uncle Polder can't recall
        any unusual problems this season.
      </li>
      <li>
        He's met

        >
        and knows the farm she works at, though it's part of another pact. It's
        not far from Uncle Polder's, but people in Ulgoth's Beard mostly stick
        close to home. The farmers of the two pacts don't interact often.

        might not be a good fit for life in Ulgoth's Beard, and

        and others of her pact came to Uncle Polder's pact a couple weeks ago to
        trade for tools, she seemed to be embracing life in Ulgoth's Beard. She
        spoke of how happy she was that someone named Culley was coming to join
        her soon. Uncle Polder assumed Culley was another worker coming late to
        the farm.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      From their conversation with
      <strong

          >Aunt Dellie</a
        ></strong

      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png"
          >Kianna</a
        ></strong
      >'s friend who drowned many years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      If told the truth about Culley, Uncle Polder is surprised;
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Kianna.png"
          >Kianna</a
        ></strong
      >
      spoke as if Culley were a close and current friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Polder allows the characters to rest at his home as long as they
      please. When they're ready to go, he gives them detailed directions to the
      farm

      As the characters continue on their journey, they notice the environment
      changing around them after only another hour of travel. After they've
      travelled about a mile from Uncle Polder's home, read or paraphrase the
      following description:
    </p>
    <em

        The open fields have all but vanished behind sparse woods at the far
        edge of Ulgoth's Beard. The air smells stagnant and carries the taste of
        metal. Through the trees, multiple small farmhouses hunch amid a patch
        of green fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly the ground begins to shake, causing the road ahead to ripple,
        but just as quickly as it started, the shaking fades away.
      </p></em

    <p>
      A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check realizes
      the tremor likely wasn't an earthquake but something local, such as a
      collapsing cave or something moving underground.

      After another 10 minutes of travel, another tremor shakes the ground. This
      time, the tremor causes a 10-foot-square, 10-foot-deep sinkhole to open
      beneath

      isn't with the party). Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15
      Dexterity saving throw or fall 10 feet, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.
      Characters who said they would be mindful of sinkholes or unstable ground
      after the previous tremor have advantage on this saving throw.

      scrabble free from the dirt at the bottom of the pit and attack any
      creatures within. After the Undead are dispatched, any character who
      examines the disembodied hands and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception)
      check can tell that the creatures were digging through the loose earth,
      though it's not clear to what end.

      is a part of isn't just one farm, but a cooperative of adjacent farms. As
      the characters reach the location Uncle Polder directed them to, they find
      seven farmhouses, each about an eighth of a mile apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the characters approach the nearest farm, they find the surrounding
      fields overgrown and the plants rotting. Crows flit between perches on the
      fences, but there are no signs of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly all the houses have been sloppily painted with a large and muddy
      red X. The interiors of these farmhouses are utilitarian, featuring only a
      few rooms for sleeping and a small kitchen. No creatures are within, and
      the accumulation of dust makes it clear no one's disturbed the rooms for
      some time. Every farmhouse bears a sign that something's wrong. Roll on

      <strong>Farming Implements.</strong> A character who looks around the back
      of the house sees a pitchfork stuck into the earth near the house's
      northeast corner. On further investigation, they see it's stuck through
      the severed hand of a young woman. The characters have no way of knowing

    <p>
      <strong>Sickly Crops.</strong> Wheat and corn struggle to grow in the
      fields surrounding the house. Any character who succeeds on a DC 14
      Intelligence (Nature) check can tell the plants around this farm are
      sickly because something's wrong with the soil. A character who succeeds
      on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check notices raised paths through the
      dirt, like mole tunnels, though no creatures are obvious. Although it's
      not evident, the soul shaker's evil and the excavations of the crawling
      claws have spoiled the land around the house.

      chair is moved, it reveals a muddy depiction of two children, one is
      reaching for the other, who is being dragged into the water by large

    <p>
      <strong>Paintings.</strong> Any character who riffles through the paper on
      the desk finds repeating images of hands, lakes, and wide eyes looking up
      through water. The largest work shows a pair of eyes with handprints for
      pupils. All these images look similar in style to the picture

      <strong>Chest.</strong> A small chest against the wall is unlocked and
      holds work clothes sized for a woman. A character who searches the chest
      and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a pair of
      overalls with a pocket containing thirteen rings, plain rings, wedding
      bands, and formal jewellery sized for men and women, worth 2d10 gp each.

    <p>
      After the crawling claws are dispatched, any character who searches the
      room thoroughly can make a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a
      successful check, the character finds several floorboards that have been
      pushed up from below, as though the crawling claws dug their way up

      In the centre of the room, four enchanted farmers stand facing each other,
      their crimson eyes unblinking. Each holds a sharp knife or farming
      implement. They don't react when the characters enter or if they are
      touched or spoken to. They react only if harmed, stolen from, or commanded

      <strong>Pantry.</strong> The foodstuffs and supplies that once filled the
      pantry have been ransacked, and a large cupboard stands open. A trapdoor
      in the pantry's floor opens to reveal a 10-foot-tall ladder descending

      the story of a young man named Culley. Rather than its usual content,
      where the boy dies by drowning, the song has been sloppily rewritten to
      feature Culley being saved by his closest friend.

        The tunnel opens into a lantern-lit, packed-dirt chamber, where the
        cause of the stench becomes apparent. A dozen bodies lie strewn across
        the floor, all wearing the clothes of farmers. Many of their limbs have
        been cleanly removed and set into a sizable pile on the far side of the
        cavern. In the centre of the room, a young woman is singing.

      When it reveals itself, the soul shaker targets a character with its
      telepathy, whispering things like &quot;Come play with us!&quot;,
      &quot;Are you lonely?&quot;, and &quot;Be with us forever!&quot; as it
      attacks. It might also relate snippets from the &quot;Fractured Soul&quot;
      section of the adventure's background.

      shares that she blames herself for Culley's death at Cradlelace Lake, and

      If asked about or shown her paintings from areas F3 or F4, she has no

    <p>
      If any of the farmers survived, the crimson hue vanishes from their eyes
      after the soul shaker's destruction, and they thank the characters for
      saving them. Even if the farmers in the house didn't survive, one or two
      lost in the fields arrive at the farmhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmers remember only snippets from the last few days, and the last
      thing they recall clearly is preparing to return to Gullet Cove for the
      Awakening Festival. They also share that

      had been behaving strangely, growing increasingly convinced that her dead
      friend was speaking to her. The farmers can also relate details from the
      adventure's background or about Cradlelace Lake if asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the farmers can't reward the characters with much in the way of
      wealth, they gift the group a Heward's Handy Haversack they had stashed
      with tools in a nearby shed. The first character to open it, however,
      finds that a <strong>crawling claw</strong> has gotten itself trapped
      within. It tries to escape as soon as it is detected.

      Arriving back at Gullet Cove the festivities have resumed. It would seem
      that once the characted defeated the soul shaker, the enchanted farmers
      have regained all their awareness.
