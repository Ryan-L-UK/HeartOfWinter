# The Siege Is Over

<aside>
🪧 The crisis of war has been adverted, by your respective hands no less, and the criminal Le-Furr is heading off to answer his crimes. Well more like he is going to lose his head BECAUSE of his crimes, but either way, you have not heard anything since, which you can only assumed is someone good news, in its own little way. Each of you took some well deserved time off over the past few weeks and decided to pursue some of your own interests. Your paths no doubt crossed at points, but you each tended to go your own way. You all agreed to meet mid morning today at The Water Bowl as last night it appeared to be the scene of a lot of commotion. On your respective walks over, a couple of you heard the townsfolk telling stories of what happened.

</aside>

# You Dropped This?

## Inside The Inn

- The Water Bowl is a well-kept tavern with just enough frills and rough edges to make most feel comfortable.
- The dining room has a bar and several tables, enough to comfortably hold up to 30. The morning meal here is a pleasant combination of bread and honey mixed with cinnamon.
- Between the outside light through the open windows or the green driftglobe over the bar, the dining room is brightly lit. These may be used to reveal title mark glyphs’ nature (see sidebar) such as the one on the map given to the adventurers.
- A handful of commoners are here eating breakfast.
- Duric Green the co-owner of the inn tends the bar.
  - He welcomes the adventures back, even though they have never been here and asks if they have come back to get their document?
  - Last night, cleaning up after a bar brawl, Zel found a strange looking page with no names or recognizable marks but possessive of a curious glow. The inn had no other overnight customers last night, so Duric believes that it belongs to one of the adventurers and will hand it too them. Otherwise he doesn’t have the slightest clue as to whom it may belong.
  - Duric suggests they see where the page leads, offering them a free meal and drinks at the inn if they come back with an entertaining story (and a cut of whatever treasure they happen to find, you know, “a finder’s fee!” of sorts. He winks knowingly).
- The page clearly doesn’t belong to the adventurers, but finding the actual owners is impossible, The Water Bowl was simply too busy last night. Plus, with all of the rumors about treasure in town, most folks would claim the paper in the hope it might lead them to the loot. As far as Duric is concerned, the page belongs to the adventurers now.

## The Cypher

<aside>
🧩 The map is on an interesting and unusual paper. The paper itself possesses some form of strange shimmer about it, its also unusually thick. I takes little intelligence to realise this paper is far from ordinary. But the problem is its complete blank, less some strange circles and crescent moons around the edge of the page.

</aside>

- The Magical Page after light exposure:
  - Under green light the following appears: **AWEMRWNETASNYUPAPKRDAEOE**
  - Under direct sunlight: **FOUR AT A TIME. READ TOP TO BOTTOM.**
  - Under firelight: **ARRANGE IN SIX ROWS.**
- A character with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes that magical light causes the glyph’s glow.
- In near total darkness, a faint lettering will appear that reads ‘******\*\*******\*\*\*\*******\*\*******A secret only light can tell…’******\*\*******\*\*\*\*******\*\*******

To solve, take the first 4 letters from the first clue and then write down the next 4 letters in a row underneath. This arranges the letters into 6 rows that looks like this:

| A   | W   | E   | M   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R   | W   | N   | E   |
| T   | A   | S   | N   |
| Y   | U   | P   | A   |
| P   | K   | R   | D   |
| A   | E   | O   | E   |

When read from the first column, top to bottom, it reads: **“Arty Paw Waukeens Promenade.”**

The Art Paw is an Art Shop in the market district ‘Waukeens Promenade’

# A Crypt Portrait

### The Arty Paw

- The shop is on the first floor of a small 2 story building. A small, standard apartment is upstairs, and is the residence of the shop owner, Gath (a secret member of the Ouroboros).
- The shop itself is a display room, 15 feet wide by 50 feet long, with shelves spread throughout.
- A shop counter is along the back wall, next to a door leading to the back.
- Canvas artwork and painted trinkets are on display throughout.
  - Most of the art includes a white full moon, and everything inside is pure white.
- The clue the adventurers seek is the wall mounted crypt portrait behind the shop counter. ‘Full Moon Crypt’
  - The portrait features a statue pointing to a mausoleum crypt highlighted by a full moon in the background. In the centre of the painting several circles and crescent moons can be seen thanks to the pure white light, which match that same pattern of the page they have in front of them.
- No windows are present on the first floor. A chandelier candelabra provides bright white light.
  - The rope holding the candelabra can be cut, dealing 1d10 bludgeoning damage to a creature standing under it. A successful DC 15 Dexterity
    save halves the damage.
- The Location. The crypt looks like many others.
  - The adventures must either take the painting or study it long enough to note small identifying landmarks for locating the actual crypt.
  - It is common knowledge that many of the art work in the gallery were painted by local artists. There will also be memories of the graveyard from the solstice and that there were several crypts like this. Perhaps its one of them.

### Some Resistance

- At first, Gath acts as a normal shopkeep. When the adventurers show great interest in the crypt portrait, he views them as threats to his master
  to stop at all costs. He refuses all offers to sell the portrait.
- The crypt in the portrait belongs to his master, who values his privacy. Gath knows it will be a fatal mistake if his master discovers his portrait led
  others to his crypt. Gath knows nothing about the symbols on the piece, and is shocked by its resemblance to their page.
- The City Watch. If loud sounds result from a combat in the gallery, passers-by hear the disturbance. Fearing for Gath’s life, they call for the City Watch who arrive minutes later.

# The City of the Dead

### Location Description

The walled cemetery is a public park by day with the gates opening at dawn and closing at dusk. As you approach the graveyard you are greeted with an old sign carved into the stone holding the gate which reads ‘The City Of The Dead’. The last time you came here, you were on the hunt of some runaway Christmas trees and the whole land was covered in a blanket of snow. Its easy to see how that detail was overlooked.

Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (History) check recalls the City of the Dead is the only place in Gullet Cove where the deceased can be buried legally. The cemetery is vast and would take days to examine.

The City of the Dead is surrounded by a wall of cobbled stone. Inside, gravel pathways lead throughout the well-manicured gardens. Elegant mausoleums, ornate gravestones and mournful statues adorn the public park.

### **The Painting**

The image contains clues to the crypt entrance. The painting features a stone statue of a cloaked figure pointing toward a mausoleum in the foreground. The statue in the painting is easily found on a northeastern hill in the City of the Dead. From there, the mausoleum can be found by following the direction that the hand on the statue points toward.

### The Mausoleum

The mausoleum depicted in the painting is located west of the statue in the Lords’ Respite area of the cemetery and belongs to a wealthy family. The area has the following features:

- Mausoleum. This 10-foot by 15- foot mausoleum is a marble structure erected in the likeness of a stately house. Above its metal doors is a stone banner inscribed with the name “Gost.” It is 10-feet wide by 15-feet long. Inside are four alcoves with grave markers for members of the Gost family. Some of the tiles have been broken.
- Pointing Statue. The statue of a cloaked figure stands on a 5-foot square, 10-foot tall plinth, and points toward the Gost mausoleum (which is a ruse; the mausoleum isn’t the entrance to the crypts). A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, reveals the statue is a new addition to the cemetery. Any character who closely investigates the statue and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check locates a catch inside a fold of its robe that opens a secret door at its base. Otherwise, it takes an hour for them to find the way in without making checks.
- NPC’s: Commoner (Blitz - Medium Sized Mongrel) warns the adventures to be careful there have been a lot of grave robbers around of late, and that the city guard have been extra vigilant of late.

# The Great Sigil

### Location Description

The first chamber of the Chapel of Summoning is an enormous rectangular room with a carved mural on the floor depicting the Ouroboros. The great twin-headed serpentine wyverns meet face to face at the far end of the hall, their teeth wrapped around the other’s neck. Their twisting bodies, complete with two feet and two wings each cascade down the relief in mesmerizing fluid shapes ending at their tails which are conjoined at the bottom. The bound tails form a bond that cannot be broken, and from which there can be discerned no beginning or end. Six braziers (three to a side) light up the mural. The walls are lined with pillars, each of which has a word and number etched into it. The far door is firmly locked shut.

### Unlocking The Door

The pillars on the left side are numbered with odd numbers from 1 to 13 (top is 1, bottom is 13). The right side are numbered with even numbers from 2 to 14 (top is 2, bottom is 14). The words etched are as follows:

<aside>
🧩 The words etched are as follows:

1. Prime
2. Light
3. Must
4. Top
5. Be
6. King
7. Conquered
8. Rage
9. Serpent
10. Bellows
11. By
12. Overlord
13. Dark
14. Numbers
</aside>

### Solutions

The first and last words are “Prime Numbers”, and are a hint to form a phrase using only the prime numbered words (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13). The sentence forms “Light Must Be Conquered By Dark”, which is a clue to snuff out the braziers.

You may choose to roll Intelligence Checks if your adventurers cannot come to the solution. Roll with advantage if your player characters have relevant mathematical, numeromancy, or cryptographic skills, or are proficient in Navigator’s Tools, for example.

<aside>
🧩 Upon solving the puzzle by clouding the room in darkness or snuffing the braziers out, the mural will light up with an ethereal blue glow. Tracing the outline of the mural will reveal a dark spot just at the base where both tails meet. Tampering with this reveals a loose tile under which can be found the lever to open the far door.

</aside>

### ****\*\*\*\*****\*\*****\*\*\*\*****Alternative Solution****\*\*\*\*****\*\*****\*\*\*\*****

A crafty rogue or anybody with an affinity for detecting traps and secrets can bypass this puzzle by carefully examining the mural and inspecting for secrets (Investigation Check DC: 17). However, if the room is not totally dark when the door is opened, the room’s guardian, **An’kheria**, will reveal itself and attack the party. This battle will also occur if the party relights the braziers once the far door is open. The doors will swing shut immediately and battle will commence.

---

# An’kheria

A great trap door will open from above, and into the room will drop what appears to be a hideously deformed drake. Its scales are blackened with fire and its body scarred from being used as a guardian by the cult for centuries. It is missing one eye and detests the light, particularly fire light. This is the light that had been used to scar it during its brutal training as a wyrmling. Now all its beastly heart is sworn to is revenge on any who bring the fire. Once a white dragon, its wings were clipped and cauterized, but it still has teeth, fangs and its hoary ice breath, all the better to snuff out even the most resilient blaze.

### Battling The Drake

An’kheria is massive and ever in a blind rage. He takes up nearly half the floor space of the Great Sigil and will make his first priority to cast the room into darkness by targeting the blaze. Should anybody be foolish enough to attack him with fire, they will be relentlessly targeted by the dragon until they are subdued.

Once the fires are out, the dragon will be calmer and more methodical in his attacks, seeking out the greatest threat first. If the players can blind his other eye, he still can detect creatures within 10 feet of him with blindsight. This dragon will not yield, and unfortunately, the only hope for the creature is to bring an end to its misery.

When the battle is over, your heroes may proceed.

# The Summoning Circle

### Location Description

The latter chamber of the chapel is a hallway just as long as the great sigil. Six pillars line the walls closest to the door, with four braziers lighting the way to the center of the room. A massive summoning circle, threatening to call forth a beast of titanic scale, glows ominously, bathing the chamber in unholy cerulean light. On closer inspection, the circle is actually made up of six smaller circles with a void in the center where they connect. Each circle is manned by a hooded summoner on the far end. While only four summoners are visible, you notice two small chambers branch off from the center of the summoning circle, where the other two remain in wait.

At the far end of the hall is an altar with an unfortunate victim awaiting sacrifice. The young man has blond hair and wears the armor of the Ouroboros Knights, though he has removed his breastplate. Considering he is unbound, the only conclusion could be that he is a willing sacrifice to call forth his master. The great priest behind the altar wears a similar horned helmet to the knights who guarded this place, and sets down his ceremonial dagger in favor of a monstrous battle axe.

<aside>
🧩 Interlopers. You dare to profane this sacred ground with your unhallowed flesh! I shall strike you down and your blood will slake the thirst of the mighty Ouroboros!”

</aside>

### Battle With The Great Priest

Despite being present, the summoners nor the sacrifice will come to Ralof’s aid, as they are preoccupied with their duties. The party shall face Ralof Serpentsworn alone. If the party consists of four or more players, you can add one or two Ouroboros Knights to the battle. As the battle presses on, one of the summoners will collapse from the exertion, having fallen unconscious. The first summoner shall fall on the conclusion of the third round, and one summoner will fall each round until all six have fainted.

If all six summoners faint, the sacrifice is bathed in a vile cerulean light, before being consumed entirely and bringing forth the Ouroboros Emissary. If the party can defeat Ralof before the battle is over, the Summoning Ritual will fail. Even if the summoners are attacked by the party, their work will still continue from the afterlife. Any attempt to aid or remove the sacrificial Knight from the slab will have him engulfed in light early, and bring forth the Ouroboros emissary immediately.

No matter what the party does to try and tamper with proceedings, the only way to stop the summoning is to kill Ralof (or subdue him) before the summoning is complete.

### Battle With The Emissary Of TBC

Upon summoning the Ouroboros Emissary, Ralof Serpentsworn will fall dead, his life force having been consumed in the summoning of the great beast. The creature is not the true Ouroboros, but a lesser creature that serves him, taking the same shape of a twin-headed dragon. While no dragon god, it is nonetheless a powerful foe that must be destroyed lest it continues the work and calls forth the true beast himself. Its twin heads will attack the party, each snapping after its own target. It is capable of utilizing a lightning breath attack from its blue head (on the left) and a flame breath attack from its red head (on the right).

Upon the defeat of either Ralof or the Ouroboros Emissary, the temple will begin to collapse under the strain from the summoning effort. A great tremor will quake the entire structure and the party shall have to run to escape.
**Note**: While escape should be fairly straightforward, you can spice this section up with some skill challenges if you are so inclined.

---

When the party is outside, the chapel will be buried beneath the twin peaks that once towered overhead as the staggeringly high cliffs tear themselves apart under the weight of the earth. All that shall remain of the structure are the stone steps which will have cracked and risen significantly. The rise shall be so sharp as to reveal a nook on a lower level that was previously buried beneath the dirt. In this small nook is a stone chest where offerings were once placed for the mighty Ouroboros.

Opening the chest reveals a bounty of 850 gold pieces, a golden holy symbol with the Ouroboros etching (125 gp value), and four random gemstones worth 50 gp.
