    <h2 id="the-scratching-post">The Scratching Post</h2>
    <p>
      You awaken in your room with somewhat of a start. A look to the window
      shows that the sun is barely above the horizon this morning, but there is
      a lot of noise outside. It would also appear a fair amount of screaming.
      The war on making its way to Gullet Cove appears to have arrived to the
      north and the wall is under siege. You hear a collection of screaming from
      downstairs.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You go down to find that the scratching post has been turned into a
        makeshift hospital of sorts.
      </li>
      <li>
        The various tables have been covered in sheets and you can see members
        of the town soldiers laying upon them.
      </li>
      <li>
        The owner of the Scratching Post, as well as several townsfolk appear to
        be dealing with the wounds with limited skill and ability.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the table one over dog appears heavily bandaged, and currently they
        are working on a cat. But given the amount of fur lost and bandages in
        place, you would be forgiven for mistaking it.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Perez was a tabby cat, when he had fur, but right now he has a
            rather nasty set of wounds.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        At this moment a human is rushed in on a stretcher, they appear to be
        bleeding heavily. They are placed on an empty table and several people
        rush over to help.
        <ul>
          <li>
            They find the man barely alive, unconscious with what remains of a
            ballista siege bolt poking out of his chest.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The injured keep coming in, its not a pretty sight. Outside you hear
        calls to anyone able to defend the city, but no one is answering…
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You go outside and find a junior member of the golden collar standing
      calling for any and all help. Little more than a squire, their training
      would be minimal and their use less so, they are calling for anyone to
      help defend the wall to the north.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-attackers">The Attackers</h2>
    <p>
      You make your way towards the wall, the sound of fighting can be heard and
      it sounds fairly intense. The sound of screaming and violence increases as
      you get closer, the defences are crumbling and they are in dire need for
      help. Upon the wall you can see what remains of the fractured guard:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>3 Guards</li>
      <li>2 Squires Atop the wall you can see the enemy forces:</li>
      <li>Aarakocra (+ General)</li>
      <li>Harengon</li>
      <li>Tabaxi</li>
      <li>2 Golems</li>
      <li>2 Seige Weapons</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A negotiation with the enemy is possible, although they will want to fight
      and kill you without a good reason to not do so. A discussion will be
      aggressive and they will want the full surrender of the city, freedom to
      search the city for what ever they are looking for unimpeded (Le-Furr).
      They are willing to compromise and allow the party to search the city for
      them.
    </p>
    <h1 id="the-spicy-rat-caper">The Spicy Rat Caper</h1>
    <p>
      Around the area of gullet cove, there are plenty of options to find rats
      who will be more than willing to betray Le-Furr who has taken to hiding in
      the sewers. Although the best chance of finding them will be at the docks,
      which are currently on lock down.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-harbour">The Harbour</h2>
    <p>
      In the harbour you can find a few boats which have been here for a few
      days with crew that appear to be pretty annoyed about the situation. Most
      can be found on the decks laying in hammocks or in general carrying out
      maintenance on the ship. The three ships in dock currently are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Fated Dream This merchant ship has an elegant hull. The ship's
        commander is a woman named Wynna. The ship's main hold is filled with
        bales of hide.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Green Arrow This merchant ship has a broad hull. The ship's captain
        is a male rogue named Atwic. The ship's lower hold is filled with bales
        of parchment.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Sea Queen This merchant ship has a broad hull. The ship's captain is
        a male rogue named Atwic. The ship's lower hold is actually virtually
        empty, all that remains is a few questionable barrels, and the remains
        of some spoils of ill-gotten gains. She poses as a merchant ship who
        tackles the task of going too and from the mainland of gullet cove and
        the Moonshae islands, but really she sails the sea of swords taking
        ships who least expect it. The crew and the captain will be a little
        unease about being in dock for this long, as people tend to ask a few
        too many questions. It also doesnt help that a few of Le-Furrs crew have
        made their way onboard the ship after the Serpents Cry was sunk.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Serpents Cry (Wreck) Inside the harbour is what remains of the
        serpents cry. The ship was well and truly shelled and little remains
        poking above the surface. Anything the ship was carrying is the property
        of the sea now.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="the-vermin">The Vermin</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There are plenty of vermin around which can be used to find the way to
        Le-Furr. One of the rats (<strong>Tid-Bit</strong>) will be of note
        however, he will be fairly clean, slightly out of the ordinary, he will
        also smell strangely spicy. A courtesey of one of the crew of LeFurr,
        Corazón de León.
      </li>
      <li>
        If caught he will be quite hungry and will only help if offered food,
        normally stowing away on the ships holds and eating all they like, but
        this hasnt been the case for a while. He was filthy like the other rats,
        until some strange guy in a hat caught him and suggested they cook him
        and eat him down in the sewers. Some cat a man in a funny looking hat,
        and a big long scaly thing, some kind of big overgrown snake with legs.
        Breathed fire by the looks of it.
      </li>
      <li>
        He will lead them to a sewer drain before heading off to do his own
        thing on the quest for food, as he will be distracted by a great smell
        coming from one of the inns, and run off. This will be a constant theme
        for him leading them slightly astray.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="the-murky-retreat">The Murky Retreat</h2>
    <p>
      A wooden building with a straw roof, the Murky Retreat Inn stands one
      story tall. This place is regularly crowded with lots of guests. Inside,
      this tavern smells of ale, fish, and worse. As you approach, you notice
      the tavern has a fun atmosphere. The patrons are all sharing humorous
      stories with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tavern is owned by a male human named <strong>Kierat Tarth</strong> .
    </p>
    <p>Patrons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Maecy Baratheon</strong> : A middle-aged female human is sitting
        at a table, drinking alone.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Teryani Moonbow</strong> : An adolescent female elf is sitting
        at a table, arm wrestling someone else.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lyklor Tsornyl</strong> : An older male elf is sitting near the
        fireplace, trying to sell something to someone.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Emilee Thenn</strong> : A frail female human is sitting near the
        fireplace, singing a beautiful song.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Daisy Montajay</strong> : A powerful female halfling is standing
        by the bar, eating a hearty meal.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="to-the-sewers">To The Sewers</h1>
    <p>When players enter read:</p>
    <em>
      <p>
        As you walk into the sewer you are surprised to see that it is actually
        incredibly well built. Significantly better than some parts of gullet
        cove. It would appear great care and attention was placed upon the
        layout of the sewers and how they would work.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is not a surprise however, is the onslaught to your senses. It hits
        you like an Owlbear. The smell alone is enough to provoke your gag
        reflex, it also stings your eyes to have them wide open and you find
        yourself squinting to reduce the pain. Everything seems to have a
        slippery and slimy quality and the sound, the sound is just horrible.
        The echo and reverberation of sewage moving through the tunnel system is
        a sound like nothing else. What would drive a person to come down here.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a side note: DM -&gt; Players, please assume all these doorways you
        see on the map are open, unless I tell you otherwise.

    <h2 id="the-first-area">The First Area</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          There are a few caskets down here which seem to be something to do
          with the builders of the sewers, what a strange final resting place,
          althought a couple appear to have been disturbed.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>

              Investigation of the tombs will highlight that 2 of them actually

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              They have been looted, all that remains is bones and some very
              tattered and ruined clothes. Including what appears to be a very
              old robe from the temple.

          You can see a small floating wooden board on the water which is
          somehow managing to avoid the corrosion from the water. You are a
          little concern however if the water may or may not be toxic. Best not
          to touch it.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A DC 15 wisdom (perception) or intelligence (investigation) check
            will notice two shapes moving about underneath the water, this being
            two <strong>TBC.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Regardless of whether or not the players are aware of these two
            creatures, the <strong>TBC</strong> will notice them, and will
            remain passive until a creature touches the water. The only way to
            avoid them is to either exit the sewers or not touch the water.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          There are a couple of side tunnels, these will contain some old crates
          and barrels, all of which are empty. With an investigation check they
          will find that they once held spice, rum and other desirable goods,
          but they have long since been emptied.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="a-blacksmith">A Blacksmith?</h2>
    <p>
      As you approach the next section you find what appears to be some form of
      blacksmith/armoury. It has certainly seen better days, but what is more
      worrying, is it appears to have been used a fair amount, and more
      importantly, recently. The quality of the gear it could make, is certainly
      lacking somewhat, but the fact that its not only down here, but that
      people use it is what is most impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      They appear to have set up the water wheel to actually power the furnace
      and keep air flowing into it. You are somewhat concerned about the gasses
      down here and an open flame, but so far, so good. Somehow…
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual forge itself is still warm, and you can see the anvil and wet
      stones have been used to reforge something recently.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the corner a pile of old rusted weapons can be found. There is nothing
      major of note here, but it would seem they are used for spares to be
      melted down into something new. This is an old smuggers hideout and is
      clearly used infrequently by only those who know how to use it. It may
      have belonged to one of the guilds at one point, but now it seems its only
      used by the odd passing thief or rogue.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A search will find a few ingots of metal, which could be worth money,
        but they are incredibly heavy to move. You would need to take them to a
        blacksmith to have them valued. Each one weighs around 40lb’s, and
        depending on the purity, and the metal, could range in price from a few
        silver, up to maybe a few platinum for something rare or valuable. They
        are each unmarked

    <p>
      This is where the smugglers check for one of their own with a series of
      traps and snares. As the players are walking along, one will step onto a
      pressure plate floor tile which will shoot them with a crossbow bolt. They
      can make a Dex save DC15 or get hit by the wall mounted crossbow bolt. 1D8
      piercing. It will also no doubt make a loud noise as its triggered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will also be a load more barrels around here, some old and some
      newer, most empty but each one clearly has been used for something or
      another illegal. You can also find a few small barrels, scattered around,
      one with Catnip, another with anise, and a third with tobacco leaf. Each
      one of which was part of the laced set from an earlier campaign. Should
      someone wish to sample, they will pay the price. (1d6 poison per
      snort/puff.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There will also be a strange barrel around the corner with one small pouch
      in it. On the side of the barrel the label reads:
    </p>
    <em>
      Whilst you can avoid things being seen if you wish, making them disappear
      entirely, that is a rare gift.

    <p>Inside is a single pouch of ‘Dust Of Disappearance’.</p>
    <h2 id="the-shutoff-room">The Shutoff Room</h2>
    <p>
      This room is little more than a strange valve control room, and it would
      appear you can use the values to control various flows of the sewage
      throughout the system. Each is clearly marked.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Left - Shuts off the flow from the left side of the city.</li>
      <li>Middle - Master shut off valve.</li>
      <li>Right - Shuts off the flow from the right side of the city.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each valve can be turned, most will be quite stiff and will require either
      a DC18 Strength check, or two people to work. They will work as expected,
      but will alert both Le-Furr and the crew of their presence. Not to mention
      cause issues for the city above under siege.
    </p>
    <h1 id="the-main-room">The Main Room</h1>
    <p>This is the section which will no doubt result in some form of brawl.</p>
    <h2 id="the-platform-left">The Platform (Left)</h2>
    <p>
      Upon this is a small table, with four old chairs which are barely holding
      together. Upon the table appears to be a blend of maps and charts ranging
      in ages. One of the oldest maps appears to list the whereabouts of some
      treasure chest marked with an ‘X’. Although that has been ringed, and a
      further note added to explain its not there any more and was taken by a
      ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      A glance of one of the other maps, appears to highlight the route that
      ship was due to take, and an X on the map where it was sunk, marked with
      ‘treasure now here’.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of these pages seem to be various routes, charts and maps of
      hidden pathways across the sea of swords and where certain ships seem to
      travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main and more important thing of note, is that there appears to be a
      map of gullet cove, along with several potential exits from the city. Each
      one has systematically be crossed off.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-rooms-right">The Rooms (Right)</h2>
    <p>
      These rooms have been used as the bunk option for Le-Furr and his two
      crewmates. They are nothing special, but it would appear each has a bed
      which each look quite old and moth bitten, a small space for a candle, and
      in general somewhere to sleep. You imagine this would have been where
      smugglers would have stayed.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-well">The Well</h2>

      This is where you will find lefurr and his companions sitting around the
      edge. One of the companions will be sitting with his feet dangling over
      the edge. Le-furr and Corazón will be standing there, discussing the plan
      now that all the exits have been blocked and there appears to be an army
      of people trying to hunt them.

          The Crew Mates will defend le-furr, until it looks like its going
          south. They will both blame le-furr and agree to go quietly.
