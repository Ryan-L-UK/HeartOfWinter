      You all awaken, with somewhat of a start. But you are not where you once
      were. You all respectively open you eyes, and where the should be rafters
      and a thatch roof, you see nothing but a star filled sky with ornate green
      and blue nebula's. The air around you has a certain chill about it. You
      each shudder slightly in the cold. There is no smell discernible smell,
      and the only sound is ocean lapping the shoreline. As each of you sit up
      to survey the area, it is clear this isnt Gullet Cove, and its not the
      Sword Coast, you are not even sure if this is the terrestrial plane any
      more. Before you stands a city wall. Although this is like nothing you
      have every seen before. The wall stands over 50 feet high and is made of a
      white crystalline brick. In the centre a giant circle opening. The words
      ‘The Gates of Horn & Ivory’ are etched into the stone above the doors.
      There is sadly little left of the doors themselves. They appear to have
      been smashed to pieces by something big.

    <ul>
      <li>
        The door is directly in front of you, but there is little else around
        the entrance to the dreaming. You stand upon a grey small sandy beach
        which meets the ocean. The ocean itself consist of blue and purple
        waters and appears to expand indefinitely to the horizon. Either side of
        the door and wall giant rock faces climb hundreds of feet into the air,
        limiting you to two options, the doorway, or the ocean. The ocean
        appears calm and still, but the waters are far from clear, and who knows
        what manner of foul creatures may be found lurking in the deep.
      </li>
      <li>
        Standing before you is a Drow called
        <a

          >Lucienne</a
        ><strong>.</strong> Unlike standard Drows, Lucienne will actually be
        quite amenable and helpful. You feel like whilst she is a Drow, its more
        likely due to the lack of sunlight, than anything else.
      </li>
      <li>
        The pathway appears to split in three separate directions, with each
        signposted.

      Welcome friends to the Dreaming. Most of you will have visited before,
      although on saying that i see we have Felidae among us. Welcome my friends
      to the Dreaming, the Welcoming Dark no doubt misses you. My name is
      Lucienne, and I am the curator of the great library in the Palace Of
      Dreams. I have called you here because I require your assistance…The Lord
      of Dreams has gone missing.
    </em>
    <em>
      Owndership of the dreaming is divided between the Lord Of Dreams, and the
      Prince of Nightmares, and i assure you, there have been many conflicts
      between them. They often meet every few years within the Forest Of The
      Sleepless to discuss various terms to avoid an all out war. Previous
      agreements have consisted of the usual things:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Nightmare is allowed to inflict suffering on XX% of the population.
        </li>
        <li>
          And Dream wont crush nightmare into PASTE like the insects he is.
        </li>
        <li>You know, standard things.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However at the last one of these, Nightmare was somewhat displeased with
        the agreement, suggesting they should be allowed more freedom in the
        dream plane to inflict suffering on as many people as they saw fit.
        Naturally Dream shut this down immediately and each went their own way,
        spitting venom, as they did so. An in the case of Nightmare, quite
        literally. .
      </p>
    </em>
    <p>Allow some time here for questions. As I imagine there will be some.</p>
    <em>
      The plane of dreams is one of many planes of existence. We border both the
      terrestrial plane, and the celestial plane. This allows dreamers to come
      and go from this plane freely at night, before taking the great ship back
      to the terrestrial plane when their visit is over. In the past there have
      been conflicts fought between both the Dream and Celestial planes. It is
      the will of certain celestials to walk among the free folk, with the
      intention of oppressing them. Not all of them mind, but over the centuries
      they have created a sizable faction. So, to defend both us, and the
      terrestrial plane, Dream created various layers of defence to prevent them
      from gaining access, which includes these very gates. But now the Lord of
      dreams has gone missing, the dream plane and everything he built has
      started to crumble to ruins.

    <h2 id="">The Tasks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <input class="task-list-item-checkbox" checked="" type="checkbox" />
        Eradicate the Celestials
      </li>
      <li>
        <input class="task-list-item-checkbox" checked="" type="checkbox" />
        Find the Lord Of Dreams

        <input class="task-list-item-checkbox" checked="" type="checkbox" />
        Find out of the Prince Of Nightmares is somehow involved.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="">The Reward</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The favour of the Lord Of Dreams.</li>
      <li>
        Helping in the defence of the terrestrial plane from rogue celestials.
      </li>
      <li>
        And the most important, the ability to go home, as i can only summon
        you, I can not send you home, only dream can do that.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="">One Last Point</h2>
    <em>
      In the Dream Plane things are often not what they seem, and whilst the
      world may be crumbling there are many dreamers still here. For the
      dreamers they see only what they want to see, imagination is a wonderful
      thing, taking the mundane and making it amazing. You on the other hand
      will see things for what they really are. It is also worth noting that you
      are but ghosts to the dreamers, they can hear you, and interact with you,
      but like people in your own dreams. They are perceived as little more than
      a figment of the imagination. Also whilst we are on the subject of
      imagination, it is worth mentioning that should a dreamer die, their body
      disappears and the dreamer awakens exactly where they went to sleep.
      However in your case, it is not that simple. I have summoned you here, so
      these bodies, are your actual bodies. Which means not only is the magic
      real and your weapons sharp, the ability to die is also a possibility.

    <h1 id="">The Theatre Of Dreams</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There are a variety of Dreamers within the Theatre, all be it, the
        theatre itself will have seen better days.
      </li>
      <li>
        All will be still except a Dryad who will be found wandering around the
        main theatre, they will die if court, but they will point to the hedge
        maze.
      </li>
      <li>
        The dryad will be making their way towards the hedge maze, which will
        spark the test.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="">The Labyrinth Of The Eternals</h2>
    <p>How To Play The Labyrinth</p>
    <em>
      Outside I have placed a copy of the maze, with arrows highlighting a path
      to the centre. It isnt necessarily the quickest path to the centre, but if
      you follow every arrow, it will get you to the centre non the less. Each
      of you will be sent out one by one and will be allowed 20 seconds from the
      minute you leave the table to look at the map and memorise as much as you
      can. When the time is up, you must come back to the table and describe the
      route to the rest of the team, then based on your instructions, they will
      map it out on the page. YOU are not allowed to touch the page yourself,
      this is a test of both your memory and communication skills. When you have
      remembered or more appropriately forgotten as much as you can, the next
      person can go, and we continue until you have found a path to the centre.
      If we run out of time, we will pause and pick up where we left off next
      session.

    <p>(No cheating!)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Two maps, a plain gird, and the real map.</li>
      <li>
        Real map is placed in another room, plain on the table and they much

        bloodshot and he will be in considerable pain from what ever they have
        done with him.
      </li>
      <li>
        You will find the awakened tree trying to extract answers from dream on
        how to get to the waking world. But dream will not be budging on the
        matter.
      </li>
      <li>
        One of the dryads will also be trying to eat some form of pie and will

    <h2 id="">Releasing Dream</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Dream will be happy about his release and thank the party, although will
        be visibly angry about the situation. He will also ask who sent him and
        commend that Lucienne has always looked out for him.
      </li>
      <li>
        He will offer no more insight aside from being sure this has something
        to do with the disagreement with Nightmare.
        <ul>
          <li>
            He will explain that nightmare wanted control of the theatre of
            dreams, and the autonomy to torture dreamers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not just limited to the torture nightmares provide, but actually
            allow his demons to torture dreamers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dream did not stand for this and demand that nightmare stick to
            previous agreement, or suffer dreams wrath.
          </li>
          <li>This threat is probably what has caused all the issues.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        He himself will not be able to do much as he is took weak and must
        repair the damage the celestials have done to the dreaming. Sending the
        party to go and deal with them. If they have already dealt with the
        situation the party should explain at this point.
      </li>
      <li>
        He will offer them a chance to take a rest if they need it.
        <ul>
          <li>
            He will get to experience the forest of the dreamless, an honour few
            dreamers get to visit.

    <ul>
      <li>
        The Squirrel A squirrel jumps in front of your party. He wags his tail
        and tries to lead the party. If they ignore him, he will throw acorns at
        them until he can get them to follow him. After a short while of
        following they will find a Firbolg (<a

        ) who has been caught by a hunting trap and is clearly hurt. A demon
        will have laid the trap, you can tell as its black, rusty and smoking
        strangely. But there would appear to be no good reason why. Following
        the squirrel will also bring them to the edge of a strange and unusual
        looking patch of trees.

        ) is trying to start a new forest here, since his old one keeps getting
        cut down. He will let them rest in the protect grove if they help him
        sow some plants or trees.

        ‘s Husband. The party will find the remains of a simple wood cabin. The
        roof has been collapsed the walls caved in. It would appear the demons
        attempted to set fire to the place, but only half the building caught
        alight. They clearly left for some reason before the rest of the job was
        done. Inside can be found the remains of his Danore, crucified on wall.
        It would appear that they beat him mercilessly, before nailing him to
        the wall. But it would seem judging by the struggle marks, neither were
        the cause of his death. The actual cause appears to be fact he has been
        amateurishly gelded whilst on the cross. It is unclear if he died during
        the process or not, but judging by the damage, no one could survive for
        long either way.

    </ul>
    <h2 id="">A Rude Awakening</h2>
    <em>
      Whilst you are comforting Finasaer, consoling him from the loss of his
      husband, as well as the loss of his house and memories, some of you hear a
      strange noise. You look to its source, the sky, and from what you can see
      something is heading in your direction. The more you look in fact the more
      you of them you can see. A little unsure what you’re looking at you each
      get to your feet. By the time you realise what these are, its too late. As
      the first strikes the ground mere feet in front of you, you realise these
      are oversized canon balls, and that what ever launched them is not only
      big, they are carpet bombing the forest of the sleepless, and all within
      it. You attempt to turn and run, trying to bring Finsaer with you, but it
      is too late. Just as one of the hundreds of canon balls hit you, you
      awaken.
    </em>
    <em>
      You each awake, exactly where you were before, rested, although you’re not
      entirely sure how long you have been asleep for, but you are all intact,
      and dont appear to have any lasting damage from your visit to the forest.
      But you were dreamers after all, you couldnt die. The same can not be said
      for the inhabitants.
    </em>

    <h1 id="">The Palace Of Nightmares</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Party will awake and find the lord of dreams passing through the main
        room. He will be on his way to find out what the giant quakes coming
        from the Forest of the Sleepless, and if they know anything about what
        happened. Whilst they were there. He will make a small accusation as if
        they have done anything.
      </li>
      <li>
        He will then proceed to tell the party they must venture to the palace
        of nightmares and confront the Prince. Also to be prepared he might not
        listen to reason and they may find better luck at the point of a sword.
      </li>
      <li>
        They will make their way back along the road from the theatre which is
        looking a little less, destroyed from when they first went to sleep.
      </li>
      <li>
        The route will have also been trimmed which will make the whole thing
        look a lot better than it did the first time. You wonder if perhaps
        being in the vicinity of the celestial might have had an effect on their
        rapid growth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Walking to path to the palace is less pleasant. The route will be a lot
        darker and more unpleasant. The trees will slowly wilt and die. The
        grass blacken and the white brick road will turn to black broken tiles.
        They would have once been obsidian, but it would appear the passage of
        time has eroded it to little more than black sand.
      </li>
      <li>
        The golden fence has been replaced with twisted black metal, and the
        path is littered with a variety of nightmare orbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        From a distance you can see the palace it would appear to be some form
        of castle, but curiously there seems to be a fair amount of smoke rising
        from a lower level. The castle itself stands upon a cliff edge platform,
        entirely unsupported, by the ground below.
      </li>
      <li>
        As you get closer the smell of the smoke is a mix of brimstone and
        sulfer. It’s rather unpleasant.

    <h2 id="">The Map Room</h2>
    <p>
      Inside the map room will be two dryad cartographers, they will appear to

      Lets get this citadel moving. We need to make haste whilst Dream has been

      dream plane and into Faerun, we can start the real fun. Think of it, all

      spoils of war, once we broke through and controlled all of Faerun.

      control’ so she isnt going anywhere soon.

      The prince of nightmare will fall to his knees and will beg for mercy if
      he is allowed to do so. He will outline he has only ever wanted power,
      something that most people in this room probably crave in one form or
      another, even Dream himself. If a mention comes up of his plans to take
      over the waking world, he will lie and say it was

    <em>
      It was all the celestials idea…and the dragon…yes, yes, it was the dragons
      idea to take over everything.

    <p>
      This is of course a massive lie and could be perceived as such. It is up
      to players whether they elect to keep him alive or dead, they may even
      take him back to the lord of dreams.

      The castle is going down and is going to crash in the forest of the
      sleepless. The dragon will escape out of the wall and will save anyone
      else in the room with them for the right price. They have mentioned about
      the fact the dragon could take charge of this plane and they will come
      around to the idea. They will need to kill dream and lucienne to take
      control. They will be on board for the idea of ruling the land and the
      dreaming treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the crash Elstiana will be flung from the castle wreckage and will
      found both a crimson stone and the Barrel of Sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either way they can take comfort in the fact a ship can be seen in the
      harbour called ‘daybreak’ this will be the passage home to the waking
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elstiana will also start to feel the urge of the crimson stone a bit more.

    <em>
      Bidding fairwell to the dreaming and stand upon the deck of daybreak. Your
      time here has been memorable, well as memorable as a dream can be. As you
      sail towards the horizon, you are not sure at what point you blacked out,
      but it was somewhere between the sun cresting the horizon and the stars
      fading from the sky. You feel the warmth of your bed once more, and awaken
      in the room you left. Everything is where it should be, and everything you
      had seems to be with you…mostly. The more you try to remember the
      dreaming, and your time there, the more you seem to forget. You do however
      seem to have retained all your items, except for the curious carats. They
      appear to be gone.
