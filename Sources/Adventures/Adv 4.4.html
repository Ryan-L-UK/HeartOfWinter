    <h2 id="adventure-background">Adventure Background</h2>
    <p>
      Prisoner 13 is a tiefling named Korda Glintstone. Prior to her
      incarceration years ago, Korda was an ally and agent of Clan Axebreaker, a
      moderately influential dwarf clan in a stronghold called Gauntlgrym. Korda
      built a network of informants and agents, ostensibly all to the benefit of
      Clan Axebreaker. With each success, she paid tattooists to inscribe a
      memorial of her triumph onto her skin. Using ancient rituals, Korda
      infused many of these artful etchings with the magic of Gauntlgrym’s
      forges, granting her wondrous gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Korda grew too ambitious for her role as an agent, so she devised a plan
      to take power for herself. Over five years she took careful stock of Clan
      Axebreaker’s wealth and, in one fell swoop, used her network of
      lieutenants to steal away most of the clan’s gold, leaving only a
      pittance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Axebreaker dwarves discovered her almost immediately. They rounded up
      her agents, who either fought to the death or were executed. They captured
      Korda and interrogated her, but she never revealed the location of the
      stolen fortune, even under magical compulsion. The Axebreaker dwarves used
      their influence to have her sentenced to life in prison at Revel’s End.
      There, Clan Axebreaker was hopeful Korda would eventually break and reveal
      the location of the stolen wealth. This played right into Korda’s hands,
      since she had made copious enemies who can’t move against her while she’s
      incarcerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Korda, now known as Prisoner 13, prepared for her imprisonment by laying
      the groundwork for a new spy and criminal network, which cost her much of
      her stolen fortune. She now runs her operations from the prison. Using her
      magical tattoos, she telepathically coordinates agents throughout Faerûn
      and beyond, none of whom know the identity of their employer. As for what
      remains of the stolen Axebreaker wealth, it rests in an unmarked vault in
      the depths of Gauntlgrym, sealed by a magical lock that only the runic
      sequence tattooed on Korda’s right hand can open.
    </p>
    <h2 id="adventure-hooks">Adventure Hooks</h2>
    <p>
      After years of financial hardship due to their stolen fortune, the
      mountain dwarves of Clan Axebreaker have located the lost treasure but
      have been unable to access it. They however, are not the only ones, An old
      agent of Korda has also found it and wishes to hire the characters to
      learn how to access the treasure. <strong>Varrin</strong> Learned of the
      characters through the theives guild, as two of the party have had recent
      interactions. They have been highly recommended as the type who get things
      done.
    </p>
    <h2 id="varrins-proposition">Varrin’s Proposition</h2>
    <p>
      Varrin (lawful good, tiefling noble) contacts the characters to enlist
      their aid in retrieving the key. Varrin’s braided hair is black with
      streaks of gray. He wears a loose, comfortable robe over a steel
      breastplate. Whether Varrin approaches the characters or invites them to a
      meeting, read the following text:
    </p>
    <em>
      “Thank you for hearing me out. My name is Varrin, and I have a proposition
      for you. The Axbreaker clan, my old allies, have located wealth stolen
      from them many years ago, but it’s sealed in a vault that’s magically
      locked. If you can recover the key—whatever it is—we can unlock the vault
      and I can finally claim the treasure that is rightfully mine. I’ll cut you
      in for a percentage of the recovered treasure, of course."
      <p>
        “The catch here is Korda is the person who knows how to open the vault
        is rotting away in the prison of Revel’s End. She's proved uncooperative
        in the past, but as the dwarves and myself have recently discovered the
        vault where she hid what she stole. I need you to question her and learn
        how to open the vault. How you do that is up to you; if you need to
        spring her from the prison in exchange for this information, please do
        so. I can provide you with a way in, as well as the layout of Revel’s
        End and a few useful tricks.”
      </p></em
    >
    <p>Give the players a copy of map, and read the following text:</p>
    <em>
      Varrin retrieves a faceted sapphire the size of a small orange and places
      it on the table. He waves his hand over the gem, and a glowing blue image
      of a building floor plan appears in the air above it. He taps the gem, and
      the image vanishes. The sapphire splits into sections, and he passes one
      fragment to each of you. The fragment grows warm in your hand, melts, then
      vanishes, leaving a warm, tingling sensation behind. “Think about the map
      of Revel’s End, and you’ll be able to see it.”
    </em>
    <p>
      The gem’s magic lasts until five days after the characters reach Revel’s
      End.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-breakers-map">The Breaker’s Map</h2>
    <p>
      Each character can now cause a magical image of map 4.1 to appear in the
      air before them while they aren’t incapacitated (no action required). A
      breaker’s map isn’t visible to others while a character is viewing it.
      Varrin explains each of the features the characters can see on their maps:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cells.</strong> The cells, highlighted in red, are blanketed in
      permanent antimagic. Prisoner 13’s cell is clearly marked.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Doors and Hatches.</strong> The doors and hatches are sealed with
      arcane lock spells that only prison staff can bypass. However, while the
      characters are within 100 feet of Revel’s End, the map allows them to use
      an action to touch the image of a door or hatch and suppress the lock on
      that portal. While a lock is suppressed, its image turns green. The lock
      remains suppressed for 1 minute or until another lock is suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Patrol Route.</strong> The yellow path marked on the map is the
      regular patrol route guards take. The usual patrol rotation is once every
      20 minutes, but if the guards are suspicious, patrols will likely become
      more frequent.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-devil-in-the-details">The Devil in the Details</h2>
    <p>
      In the likely event that the characters want more information, Varrin
      answers their questions succinctly and honestly. He has spent the last of
      his personal fortune gathering information on the prison and making the
      arrangements for a team to confront Korda. These are the details he can
      provide:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Entering the Prison.</strong> The prison staff rotate out
      periodically. Varrin knows the schedule of the next rotation, and his
      agents are standing by to capture a number of guards and cooks so the
      characters can take their place (see “Approaching the Prison”).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Prisoner 13.</strong> Prisoner 13 was a trusted agent of Clan
      Axebreaker until she betrayed the clan and stole its fortune. If pressed,
      Varrin reluctantly tells the characters her name (Korda Glintstone), but
      he stresses that they shouldn’t reveal they know it. No one in the prison
      except perhaps the warden knows Prisoner 13 by her real name, so using it
      would only raise suspicion. Her cell is marked on the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key.</strong> Prisoner 13 must have the vault key or know where it
      is, but every magical method Clan Axebreaker has tried to locate the key
      has failed. Varrin presumes Prisoner 13 would give up the key only in
      exchange for freedom, but if the characters can find the key or convince
      her to give it up any other way, he’ll be just as pleased. Clan Axebreaker
      tried to arrange her release, but the Absolution Council at Revel’s End
      denied the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Meeting Prisoner 13.</strong> Visitors can request meetings with
      prisoners, but those meetings are always supervised by the warden (to
      learn about the warden, see “R21: Warden’s Quarters”). If the characters
      want to talk to Prisoner 13, their best bet is to try when she’s not in
      her cell, hopefully out of sight of the guards. Prisoners do chores such
      as emptying latrine buckets and cleaning up after meals, and they exercise
      in the courtyard daily. When prisoners are injured or fall ill, they are
      taken to the prison hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Revel’s End Details.</strong> Varrin can give a general overview
      of Revel’s End, the security features on doors and hatches, and the
      prison’s high-alert procedure (see below). Varrin also knows the armory
      has a dangerous guardian, but he doesn’t know the details.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Treasure.</strong> The treasure is locked in a vault deep beneath
      the dwarf stronghold of Gauntlgrym. Varrin promises the characters 2
      percent of whatever treasure they recover if they make it possible for him
      to open the vault. If the characters press for more, Varrin is irritated,
      but he agrees to 5 percent if the characters succeed on a DC 20 Charisma
      (Persuasion) check. Varrin notes that the warden likely has some funds
      hidden in her office or quarters, if the characters are inclined to seek
      these out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Escape Route.</strong> Varrin will have a small ship within sight
      of the prison but at a safe distance. When the characters are ready to
      leave the prison with their target, they can shine a light from the dock
      after dark, and the ship will pick them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the characters are ready to depart from their meeting with Varrin, he
      provides them each with the choice to pose as a guard or a cook. Guards
      must wear splint armor, and kitchen staff must wear simple uniforms. Cooks
      can hide light armor under their uniforms. Small characters also have the
      option to stow away inside a crate of supplies.
    </p>
    <h1 id="trek-to-the-prison">Trek to the Prison</h1>
    <p>
      Varrin has sent word to his agents, and Bethra (chaotic good, tiefling
      spy) meets the characters when they arrive in Luskan. She provides the
      uniforms for their chosen cover and directs them to report to a ship
      called the Jolly Pelican the following dawn. The ship regularly delivers a
      fresh rotation of prison staff to Revel’s End and returns the relieved
      shift to the Sword Coast. The journey to Revel’s End by sea is 350 miles,
      which a sailing ship can cover in few days under normal conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-five guards and six cooks are bound for the prison, including any
      characters taking their places. If the characters express concern over the
      fate of staff they’re replacing, Bethra assures them that none of the
      people were killed, and they’ll be released safely when the job is over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The players can make up whatever names they like for their cover. Those
      are the names of the guards or cooks they’ve replaced.
    </p>
    <h1 id="revels-end">Revel’s End</h1>
    <p>
      Revel’s End is a panopticon, a prison configured in such a way that the
      activities of the prisoners can be closely monitored from a central
      location. Situated in the middle of the Trackless Sea, the prison is a
      single-story structure topped with battlements. Rising from the core of
      the panopticon is a tower that holds the prison’s administrative offices
      and guard barracks. Both the prison and the tower are carved from a tall,
      blade-shaped rock that rises high above the sea cliffs. This rock, called
      the Windbreak, shields the tower against the brutal winds that sweep down
      from the Reghed Glacier.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can approach Revel’s End by land, sea, or air. A pier allows prisoners
      to be taken from ships up an elevator to the prison, and a mooring dock at
      the top of the tower allows prisoners to be delivered by airship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revel’s End is controlled by the Lords’ Alliance, a loose confederation of
      settlements whose current members include the cities of Baldur’s Gate,
      Mirabar, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, and Yartar; the towns of
      Amphail, Daggerford, and Longsaddle; and the dwarven stronghold of Mithral
      Hall. To be imprisoned in Revel’s End, one must have committed a serious
      crime against one or more of the member cities and been sentenced to a
      lengthy period of incarceration (typically a year or more).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each member of the Lords’ Alliance assigns one representative to Revel’s
      End, and together the representatives form a parole committee called the
      Absolution Council. Rarely are all ten council members present, since
      Revel’s End offers little in the way of comfort and amenities. If the
      council needs a tiebreaking vote to determine whether to commute a
      prisoner’s sentence, the prison warden—a neutral arbiter with no ties to
      any Lords’ Alliance member—casts the deciding vote.
    </p>
    <h2 id="prison-features">Prison Features</h2>
    <p>
      The prison, hewn from stone, has 20-foot-high outer walls and flat,
      20-foot-high ceilings throughout. Additional information about the prison
      is summarized below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Doors and Hatches.</strong> Each door and rooftop hatch is made of
      reinforced iron held shut by an arcane lock spell. Prison personnel can
      open these doors and hatches normally. A locked door or hatch is too
      strong to be shouldered or kicked open, but it can be destroyed if it
      takes enough damage. A door or hatch has AC 19, a damage threshold of 10,
      30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Heating.</strong> Interior spaces are magically heated. The
      temperature in these areas is a constant 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees
      Celsius). The exterior of the prison, including the guard towers, is 0
      degrees Fahrenheit (−18 degrees Celsius) or colder. Creatures outside the
      prison are exposed to extreme cold (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Lighting.</strong> Unless a location states otherwise, the
      courtyard, corridors, rooms, and staircases are brightly lit with
      continual flame spells cast on wall sconces. (The unlit cells in area R17
      are exceptions.) In some locations, the magical lights can be dimmed or
      suppressed, as noted in the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Prison Guards.</strong> The prison has a garrison of 75 guards
      (use the veteran stat block) who work eight-hour shifts. Two-thirds of the
      garrison is off duty and resting in area R19 at any given time. While on
      duty, each guard wears a tunic that bears the Lords’ Alliance emblem: a
      gold crown on a red field.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Prisoners.</strong> All prisoners in Revel’s End are identified by
      a number. This simple protocol keeps prisoners on an equal footing. Prison
      personnel commit these numbers to memory, and the records of all
      prisoners—past and present—are stored in area R22. Each inmate wears a
      uniform that consists of a hoodless robe without pockets, leather slippers
      without laces, and cloth undergarments. While outside their cells,
      prisoners wear manacles on their wrists and ankles. While manacled, a
      prisoner’s walking speed can’t exceed 10 feet.
    </p>
    <h2 id="approaching-the-prison">Approaching the Prison</h2>
    <p>When the characters approach the prison, read the following text:</p>
    <em>
      Perched on a high cliff overlooking the Trackless Sea is a bleak stone
      fortress carved from a gigantic, blade-shaped rock. A central tower looms
      above the rest of the fortress, and light leaks from its arrow slits. Four
      smaller towers rise from the outermost corners of the fortress, and guards
      can be seen atop them.
    </em>
    <p>
      Characters might approach the prison via the Jolly Pelican, or they might
      choose to approach on their own (see “Getting Inside” below).
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters approaching from the north can also see the prison’s northern
      entrance at the top of a 160-foot-high cliff with a pier protruding from
      its base. A giant wooden crane stands nearby, and a wooden scaffold clings
      to the cliff face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters approaching from the south can see the prison’s south entrance
      and the trail that leads up to it.
    </p>
    <h3 id="extreme-cold">Extreme Cold</h3>
    <p>
      The temperature outside is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (−18 degrees
      Celsius) while the characters are at the prison. A creature exposed to the
      cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each
      hour or gain 1 level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity
      to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures
      wearing cold-weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and
      creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.
    </p>
    <h3 id="guards-on-watch">Guards on Watch</h3>
    <p>
      The prison has four guard towers (see area R9), and three guards in
      cold-weather clothing are stationed atop each one. If you need to make
      Wisdom (Perception) checks for the guards to determine if they notice
      something, make only one roll with advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the guards on a tower see or hear something out of the ordinary—such as
      an approaching ship, a group of visitors, or a monster flying overhead—one
      guard descends into the tower to alert the rest of the prison while the
      others stay at their posts.
    </p>
    <h3 id="getting-inside">Getting Inside</h3>
    <p>
      If the characters use the cover Varrin provided, their ship arrives at
      Revel’s End just before dawn, three days after leaving Gullet Cove. The
      characters are directed off the ship, ride the elevator to the cliff top,
      and are admitted through the front doors. Characters posing as guards are
      taken to the barracks (area R19), where they meet with head guard Yula
      Dargeria, a no-nonsense stickler for the prison’s rules. Characters posing
      as cooks are delivered to the kitchen (area R8), where they report to Chef
      Tiny Toulaine, a hulking, jovial man who carries an enormous saucepan
      instead of a heavy crossbow. Small characters who stowed away in supply
      crates are taken to either the storeroom (area R13), the kitchen’s cold
      storage room (the middle room off area R8), or the pantry (the
      northernmost room off area R8). If more than one Small character stows
      away, pick one location where they’re all delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters who bang on the prison’s north or south door are admitted into
      a 30-foot-long corridor, where they are greeted by the three guards from a
      nearby guard room (area R3). These guards insist on confiscating the
      characters’ weapons and storing them in a nearby lockbox. In addition, one
      guard searches each character for concealed weapons. A character can
      conceal a dagger or similarly sized weapon from a guard’s notice with a
      successful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the characters have sled dogs or pack animals, a guard grants the party
      access to the stables (area R5), where the animals can be kept safe.
      Animals aren’t allowed in the prison otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      After relinquishing their weapons and securing their animals, the
      characters are escorted by one of the guards to the meeting room (area
      R12), where they must wait one hour for the warden to greet them. During
      this time, the characters are unattended and can attempt to sneak into the
      prison at large. Doing so without alerting the guards requires a
      successful DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check. Recovering the characters’
      weapons from the lockbox requires a successful DC 16 Dexterity check with
      thieves’ tools. If the characters are caught attempting either of these
      tasks, the guards return them to the meeting room and wait with them for
      the warden, who throws them out unless they provide a satisfactory reason
      for their visit and subterfuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warden only accepts the characters’ presence if they are seeking
      shelter. In that case, she grants them temporary accommodations (in area
      R7) for up to two days and two nights, and the characters receive three
      meals a day during their stay. If the characters fail to provide a
      satisfactory reason for their visit, the warden has their weapons and
      animals returned to them before throwing them out.
    </p>
    <h2 id="suspicion">Suspicion</h2>
    <p>
      Activities outside the daily routine of the prison draw attention from the
      guards and what few other staff members there are. Suspicion is measured
      in levels from 1 to 6. When the characters arrive at the prison, the
      suspicion level is 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suspicion can increase when prison staff members witness or find evidence
      of behavior outside the norm. Circumstances that increase the suspicion
      level include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a prisoner’s real name while in the guise of prison staff</li>
      <li>Getting caught by a patrol (see Patrol Routes)</li>
      <li>
        Casting a spell that has perceptible components or effects in sight of a
        guard
      </li>
      <li>
        Conversing with a prisoner about anything other than prison business
        (such as giving them instructions for tasks)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For suspicion to increase, prison staff members must witness the
      characters performing unusual activity, and any witnesses must report
      their observations. If the characters can convince the witness what they
      saw was justified, the suspicion level doesn’t increase.
    </p>
    <h3 id="distractions">Distractions</h3>
    <p>
      A character can create a distraction, giving themself or an ally time to
      undertake a suspicious activity without being witnessed. If the
      distracting character succeeds on a Charisma (Deception) check against a
      DC set by the current suspicion level (see the Suspicion table), the
      suspicious activity goes unnoticed. Use your discretion to decide if any
      given activity is subtle enough to be covered by a distraction. For
      example, a glib conversation can’t cover up an explosion.
    </p>
    <h3 id="effects-of-suspicion">Effects of Suspicion</h3>
    <p>
      As the suspicion level increases, patrols become more frequent, and the
      prison staff become increasingly vigilant. At suspicion level 6, the
      warden puts the prison on high alert.

      <strong>Level.</strong> The current suspicion level is reduced by 1 (to a
      minimum of 1) every 8 hours if the prison staff detects no suspicious
      activity during that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Patrol Die.</strong> Roll a die based on the current suspicion
      level when characters enter the patrol route to see if they encounter a

    <h2 id="high-alert">High Alert</h2>
    <p>
      When a matter of concern is brought to her attention, the warden (see area
      R21) decides whether to place the prison on high alert. Circumstances that
      warrant taking such action include a prisoner revolt, an escape, the
      approach of an unfamiliar ship, a dragon sighting, an attack, discovering
      a dead body, or suspicious activity (see “Suspicion” above).
    </p>
    <p>
      By speaking the command word, “maristo,” the warden—and only the
      warden—can place the prison on high alert (or speak it again to end the
      high alert), with the following effects:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>High-Alert Signals.</strong> For 1 minute, a warning horn blares
      throughout the prison, and all light created by continual flame spells in
      the prison takes on a reddish hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Prison Deployment.</strong> The guards in area R19 don their
      armor, arm themselves, and move to area R18. The warden does the same and
      commands the garrison from there. Members of the Absolution Council
      retreat to area R20.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>See Invisibility.</strong> The warden and all prison guards gain
      the benefit of a see invisibility spell.
    </p>
    <h2 id="patrol-routes">Patrol Routes</h2>
    <p>
      Guards regularly patrol in pairs from the guard rooms (area R3,
      alternating which room for each patrol) around the hexagon (area R15),
      with short checks into the courtyard (area R11) and the armory (area R10).
      The route is marked in yellow on the players’ map of Revel’s End. It
      normally takes 4 minutes for a patrol to make its round and return to its
      post.
    </p>
    <p>
      When one or more characters enter an area marked on the patrol route, roll
      a die. The size of the die rolled is determined by the current suspicion
      level of the prison, as indicated on the Suspicion table. On a 1, the
      characters encounter a patrol. Ask the players how their characters react,
      and give them 1 round of actions. The characters can try to slip away if
      there is a nearby exit or corner to duck around by making a group
      Dexterity (Stealth) check or try to blend in by making a group Charisma
      (Deception) check. Each check is made against a DC set by the current
      suspicion level. On a failure, the patrol notices the characters, who must
      account for their presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the characters try to talk their way past a patrol, have one of the
      characters make a Charisma check using Deception, Intimidation, or
      Persuasion, depending on their story, against a DC set by the suspicion
      level. If other characters support the story, the check is made with
      advantage. On a success, the patrol lets them go. On a failure, the patrol
      escorts the characters to a guard room (area R3), where the guard
      interrogates the characters about the characters’ presence in a prohibited
      area. If the characters have a cover story for being in the prison, the
      guards escort them to where they should be: the kitchen staff’s quarters
      (the largest side room off area R8) or the barracks (area R19) in the case
      of off-duty guards. The suspicion level then increases by 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the characters encounter a patrol, don’t check for another patrol
      when the characters enter the route until 20 minutes have passed.
    </p>
    <h1 id="revels-end-locations">Revel’s End Locations</h1>
    <p>
      The following locations are keyed to Revel’s End, as shown on map 4.2.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r1-dock">R1: Dock</h3>
    <p>Ships dock here to offload prisoners and supplies.</p>
    <h3 id="r2-elevator">R2: Elevator</h3>
    <p>
      A sturdy wooden scaffold clings to the 160-foot-high cliff separating the
      prison from the dock. Looming above the scaffolding is a wooden crane that
      is controlled from area R3. The crane raises and lowers an elevator car
      that has a retractable wooden gate on the side opposite the crane. The
      elevator car is a hollow wooden cube measuring 10 feet on each side. It
      takes 1 minute for the car to travel all the way up or down the scaffold.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r3-guard-rooms">R3: Guard Rooms</h3>
    <em>
      This room contains a table with four chairs, and a cabinet holding
      whetstones and other simple supplies for repairing armor and weapons.
    </em>
    <p>
      Three guards (veterans) are stationed in each of these two rooms. The
      guards pass the time by playing cards, sharpening their weapons, and
      complaining about the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Embedded in the north wall of the northern guard room is an iron lever
      that raises and lowers the elevator in area R2. During a patrol, two of
      the guards leave the room to make their rounds for 4 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r4-hospital">R4: Hospital</h3>
    <p>
      <em
        >This chamber contains a dozen simple beds. Cabinets along the north
        wall hold medical supplies.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabinets hold enough supplies to assemble twenty healer’s kits, five
      vials of antitoxin, and various other medicines and tinctures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these substances are poisonous if ingested in the wrong
      proportion. A character proficient with alchemist’s supplies, a poisoner’s
      kit, an herbalist’s kit, or the Medicine skill can identify the tinctures
      and combine them into an ingested poison. A creature that ingests the
      poison must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving
      throw, it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage and becomes poisoned for 1 hour. On
      a successful saving throw, it takes half as much damage and isn’t
      poisoned. In either case, the creature has painful stomach cramps until it
      finishes a short rest, drinks a vial of antitoxin, or is targeted by an
      effect that ends the poisoned condition. If a prisoner suffers these
      cramps, the guards bring the prisoner to the hospital to be examined and
      treated. Characters disguised as guards can volunteer for or be assigned
      that duty.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r5-stables">R5: Stables</h3>
    <p>
      Visitors who bring mounts, sled dogs, pack animals, or pets to Revel’s End
      can keep their animals here. The prison doesn’t supply food for animals,
      however.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r6-mess-hall">R6: Mess Hall</h3>
    <p>
      Prison personnel dine here. Tables and benches fill the room, and dishes
      and dulled cutlery are stored in cabinets along the south wall. The mess
      hall serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The characters can meet here
      without arousing any suspicion.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r7-councilors-quarters">R7: Councilors’ Quarters</h3>
    <p>
      These ten rooms are furnished identically. Each contains a bed, a desk
      with matching chair, a claw-footed chest, and wall hooks for hanging
      clothes. The continual flame spell that illuminates each room can be
      suppressed or returned to its normal light level by uttering the command
      word, “lights.”
    </p>
    <p>
      These rooms are set aside for the ten members of the Absolution Council,
      though only three rooms are currently in use. The other seven members of
      the council are absent, so the warden lets visitors use the spare rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Council Members.</strong> These three members of the Absolution
      Council are at Revel’s End:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Councilor Voss Anderton.</strong> Voss represents the city of
      Neverwinter. He is a lawful neutral, human noncombatant who has a precise,
      lawyerly way of speaking. He never misses a council meeting or parole
      hearing. He votes with his head, not his heart, and he always weighs the
      ramifications of commuting a prisoner’s sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Councilor Jil Torbo.</strong> Jil represents the city of Baldur’s
      Gate. She is a neutral, halfling noncombatant who loathes her job. She has
      no sense of humor and sighs deeply when her patience is tested. She likes
      giving others the benefit of the doubt, however—perhaps as an act of
      dissent—and votes yes on commutations more often than not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Councilor Kriv Norixius.</strong> Kriv represents the town of
      Daggerford. He is a lawful good, dragonborn noncombatant of silver dragon
      ancestry. He hopes to impress the Duchess of Daggerford by doing a good
      job. He has no tolerance for unrepentant criminals and often votes no on
      commutations.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r8-kitchen-and-side-rooms">R8: Kitchen and Side Rooms</h3>
    <p>
      Six cooks (neutral, human commoners) take shifts here, working in pairs to
      produce meals for the prisoners and staff. The kitchen contains everything
      one would expect to see, as well as an iron stove and a pump that draws
      water from a magically heated cistern on the roof. Off-duty cooks sleep in
      the largest of the three rooms west of the kitchen. This side room is lit
      by continual flame spells that can be suppressed or activated by uttering
      the command word, “lights.” The middle side room—not heated, unlike the
      rest of the prison—is used for cold storage. The smallest side room is a
      well-stocked pantry.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r9-guard-towers">R9: Guard Towers</h3>
    <p>
      Each of these four triangular towers is two stories tall. A tower’s
      interior chamber is empty except for a wooden ladder that climbs to an
      iron hatch held shut by an arcane lock spell (see the “Prison Features”
      section for more details). This hatch leads to the tower’s flat rooftop,
      which is lined with battlements. Three Lords’ Alliance guards (veterans)
      in cold-weather clothing are stationed on the roof of each tower.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r10-armory">R10: Armory</h3>
    <p>
      <em
        >This room contains wooden racks and chests filled with weaponry.
        Floating in the middle of the room is a spherical creature with a large
        central eye and four writhing eyestalks.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The inventory is nonmagical and includes twenty halberds, fifteen
      longswords, fifteen shortswords, ten pikes, ten heavy crossbows, five
      light crossbows, and hundreds of crossbow bolts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The armory is guarded by a spectator that treats the weapons as treasure.
      It knows every member of the prison staff on sight. It won’t leave the
      room and attacks anyone it doesn’t recognize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hatch. A wooden ladder leads to an iron hatch in the ceiling. An arcane
      lock spell seals the hatch (see the “Prison Features” section for more
      details), which opens onto the roof.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r11-courtyard">R11: Courtyard</h3>
    <p>
      This courtyard is paved with flagstones, which are covered with drifting
      snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the weather allows, prisoners are brought here—individually or in
      small groups—for fresh air and exercise. They are watched closely by
      guards on the ground as well as the guards on the corner tower. Characters
      can speak quietly with a prisoner without being noticed from the tower.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r12-meeting-room">R12: Meeting Room</h3>
    <p>
      This room holds a large, rectangular table with a single chair on one long
      side and three similar chairs on the opposite side. The room is used for
      meetings with prisoners or the warden.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hatch.</strong> A wooden ladder leads to an iron hatch in the
      ceiling that opens onto the roof. An arcane lock spell seals the hatch
      (see the “Prison Features” section for more details).
    </p>
    <h3 id="r13-storeroom">R13: Storeroom</h3>
    <p>
      Supplies are stored here in crates and other containers. At present, the
      prison has stockpiled enough necessities to continue operations for six
      months.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r14-privy">R14: Privy</h3>
    <p>
      This room contains a dozen wooden waste buckets. Once per day, usually in
      the morning, manacled prisoners carry the buckets outside the prison and
      dispose of the waste while watched by guards.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r15-hexagon">R15: Hexagon</h3>
    <p>
      This corridor allows guards and visitors to access the outermost rooms of
      the prison while avoiding the panopticon (area R16) and its prison cells
      (area R17). The guards refer to this corridor as “the hexagon” because of
      its shape.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r16-panopticon">R16: Panopticon</h3>
    <p>
      <em
        >This hexagonal chamber is a large open space at the center of the
        prison. Cells line the chamber walls, and a smaller hexagonal room
        occupies the center of the space.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The continual flame spells that light this area can be dimmed from the
      surveillance hub (area R18). The hall is dimly lit at night.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r17-cells">R17: Cells</h3>
    <p>
      <em
        >Each cell is enclosed by formidable steel bars. Bolted to the back wall
        are iron bunk beds, each with a thin mattress. A waste bucket sits near
        the beds.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoners are kept in these unlit cells (effectively illuminated by
      the lights in R16) behind barred gates that can be opened only from area
      R18. The gates are too secure to be forced open using brute strength or
      weapons, and magical attempts to open or bypass them are thwarted by
      permanent antimagic fields. Each field encompasses one cell and its gate.
      Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a
      deity, are suppressed in an antimagic field and can’t protrude into it.
      While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends
      suppressed counts against its duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bolted to the back wall of each cell is an iron bunk bed with thin
      mattresses and a waste bucket nearby. Prisoners take their meals in their
      cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Prisoners.</strong> Each of the twenty-four cells can hold one or
      two prisoners. Roll 4d10 to determine the number of prisoners currently
      incarcerated at Revel’s End, give each one an identification number, and
      distribute them in the cells as you see fit. Numbers are assigned in the
      order in which the prisoners arrive and are never reused. The
      longest-serving prisoner currently incarcerated at Revel’s End is Prisoner
      6, and the newest one is Prisoner 299. Prisoner 13 (see the “Roleplaying
      Prisoner 13” section later in this adventure for more details) has no
      cellmate. Her cell is marked on map 4.1.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add detail to other inmates, roll on the Prisoners table or choose
      entries you like. If a prisoner’s game statistics become necessary, choose
      an appropriate stat block from the Monster Manual, and remove armor,
      weapons, and other gear.

      The stairs lead to areas R19 through areaR23. Seven guards (veterans) are
      stationed in this surveillance hub. One sits at a console south of the
      staircase. The other guards watch the prisoners through 4-foot-tall,
      1-foot-wide arrow slits in the walls. Hanging on the walls between the

      or brightened by uttering the command word, “lights.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When the prison isn’t on high alert, fifty guards (veterans without armor
      or weapons) sleep in the bunks. The guards keep their armor and weapons
      within easy reach. They keep other belongings in unlocked footlockers
      tucked under their bunk beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guards need 10 minutes to don their armor. If the prison is put on
      high alert, the guards take the time to put on their armor before making
      their way down to area R18.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r20-hall-of-absolution">R20: Hall of Absolution</h3>
    <p>
      The floor of this room is 120 feet above the prison roof. A spiral
      staircase connects the room to the other levels of the tower (area R18 is
      140 feet down, area R19 is 20 feet down, and area R23 is 20 feet up).
      Narrow windows line the outer walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long, slightly curved table with eleven chairs takes up much of the
      room. The middle chair has no special adornments, while the others have
      banners hanging over their high backs, each one emblazoned with the crest
      of a Lords’ Alliance member. Banners hanging on the walls display the
      alliance’s emblem: a golden crown on a red field.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Absolution Council Meetings.</strong> Members of the Absolution
      Council gather here to weigh the merits of releasing prisoners whom one or
      more council members have recommended for parole. No prisoner can receive
      such consideration more than once a year. Prisoners up for parole are
      brought to this room in manacles and given a chance to sway the council
      members before votes are cast. The warden (see area R21), who always
      attends such meetings, sits in the middle chair and casts the tiebreaking
      vote, if necessary.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r21-wardens-quarters">R21: Warden’s Quarters</h3>
    <p>
      The arcane lock on this door can be opened only by the warden. Beyond the
      door is a comfortable bedchamber lit by a continual flame spell that can
      be dimmed or brightened by uttering the command word, “vaudra.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Prison Warden.</strong> The calm and unflappable warden of Revel’s
      End is Marta Marthannis, a lawful good, human mage who speaks Common,
      Draconic, Dwarvish, and Orc. She wears a red robe with gold trim and keeps
      a ring with seven tiny keys hanging from it in one pocket. One key unlocks
      the warden’s chest (see “Treasure” below); the others unlock the desk
      drawer and the cabinets in the warden’s office (area R22).
    </p>
    <p>
      Warden Marthannis is secretly a member of the Harpers, a faction that
      works behind the scenes to keep power out of the hands of evildoers. In
      her current position, she works to keep some of the Sword Coast’s worst
      malefactors behind bars. So far, the warden has managed to conceal her
      Harper affiliation from everyone else in the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Marthannis’s Possession.</strong> Unlike her membership in the
      Harpers, Marthannis hasn’t concealed the fact that she is periodically
      possessed. Lodged inside her is the spirit of a deceased adventuring
      companion: a lawful good, shield tiefling fighter named Vlax Brawnanvil.
      The spirit of Vlax takes control of Warden Marthannis once or twice a day,
      each time for an hour or two—though never while she’s performing important
      duties, such as supervising prisoner meetings with visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      While under Vlax’s control, the warden can’t cast her prepared spells or
      use the command word for high alert (see the “High Alert“ section), speaks
      only Dwarvish, and occasionally indulges Vlax’s vice for ale and spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warden Marthannis knows that to rid herself of Vlax’s spirit, she must
      visit the Brawnanvil crypts in Gauntlgrym, a dwarven fortress under Mount
      Hotenow (near Neverwinter), where the spirits of Vlax’s kin can persuade
      Vlax to join them in the afterlife. The warden refuses to make the
      journey, however, because she can’t bear to lose all contact with Vlax.
      The warden has made her state known to the prison guards and Absolution
      Council members, and they have grown accustomed to her personality changes
      and bouts of revelry. The possession hasn’t affected the warden’s ability
      to carry out her duties, and so far, no one has questioned her fitness for
      her job.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Treasure.</strong> Among the chamber’s furnishings is a locked
      wooden chest, for which the warden carries the only key. A character using
      thieves’ tools can use an action to try to pick the lock, doing so with a
      successful DC 20 Dexterity check.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chest holds a set of calligrapher’s supplies, a sack containing 750 gp
      (money that’s used mainly to pay ship captains who drop off prisoners and
      cargo), and a silver cloak pin (25 gp) bearing the symbol of the Harpers:
      a tiny harp nestled between the horns of a crescent moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any character who searches the chest for secret compartments finds one in
      the lid. It holds a wand of binding that the warden keeps for emergencies.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r22-office">R22: Office</h3>
    <p>
      <em>
        A heavy desk stands in the middle of the room with parchment, quills,
        and ink at the ready. Five heavy wood cabinets line the east wall.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Prison records are stored here in the locked cabinets. The cabinets also
      contain ship cargo manifests and records of past deliveries, as well as
      prisoner transfer orders and a ledger documenting the names, crimes,
      sentences, and commutations of every prisoner who has been incarcerated at
      Revel’s End. The records include death certificates for prisoners who died
      while incarcerated. The cause of death is always given as “natural,”
      “accidental,” or “unnatural,” with no details.
    </p>
    <p>
      A desk in the middle of the room has ten financial ledgers packed into a
      locked side drawer. The keys for the desk and the cabinets are in the
      warden’s possession. A character with thieves’ tools can use an action to
      try to pick the lock on the desk drawer or one of the cabinets, doing so
      with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r23-tower-roof">R23: Tower Roof</h3>
    <p>
      This flat rooftop is 140 feet above the prison roof and 300 feet above sea
      level. Three 6-foot-high walls to the north, southwest, and southeast
      provide limited cover, but much of the rooftop is exposed to the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wooden drawbridge can be lowered on one side to create an airship dock.
      An action is required to raise or lower the drawbridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      No guards are stationed here. If the guards in the prison watchtowers
      (area R9) see an airship or an airborne threat approaching Revel’s End,
      they alert the rest of the prison. The warden then dons cold-weather
      clothing and heads to the roof to greet the airship crew or deal with the
      airborne threat herself.
    </p>
    <h1 id="prisoner-13">Prisoner 13</h1>
    <p>
      The first time the characters encounter Prisoner 13, read the following:
      This tightly muscled tiefling woman keeps her red hair cut short. Her
      bronze skin is covered in tattoos that stretch from her collarbone to her
      ankles. She surveys you with unimpressed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prisoner 13 is a cunning schemer, ruthless and patient. She listens and
      watches, absorbing every detail she can, and shares as little as she can
      get away with. Prisoner 13 is comfortable with her lot in life, enjoying
      the anonymity and ironic protection of Revel’s End like a warm blanket on
      a winter night. While confined to her antimagic cell, she is cautious
      since she can’t rely on her magic tattoos to defend herself. Outside her
      cell, she grows overly confident and even banters if she’s able to do so
      without being caught by guards. In battle she poses a potent threat,
      creating blasts of flame and striking with magical force in both melee and
      ranged combat. She spends her time contemplating the web of schemes she
      learns through the eyes, ears, and hands of her agents outside the prison.
      While outside her cell during daily exercise in the courtyard or during
      chores, she contacts her agents for updates and makes arrangements that
      keep her network running.
    </p>
    <h2 id="prisoner-13s-tattoos">Prisoner 13’s Tattoos</h2>
    <p>
      Most of Prisoner 13’s inkwork is covered by her uniform. Her tattoos
      include the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tiefling Poetry.</strong> An excerpt from a poem in Infernal
      script on her neck and across her shoulder blades reads, “Endless dreams
      entombed in stone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Flames.</strong> A roiling storm of brilliant flames covers her
      back and ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Shroud.</strong> Black and gray smoke and shadows coil down her
      left arm, ending in runes on the fingers of her left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Knotwork.</strong> Purple and blue knotwork and runes run down her
      right arm, across the back of her right hand, and down the length of each
      finger. The runes on her fingers, known as the keystone tattoo, form the
      key to the vault in Gauntlgrym. The characters must acquire this key to
      complete their mission (see “Acquiring the Key” below).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mountain.</strong> Silver and brown mountain peaks cover her
      chest, the tips following the angles of her collarbones.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>River.</strong> Swirling green and blue waters form a cascading
      river across her stomach, with scaly creatures leering from the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Power and Plunder.</strong> Infernal script on her hips reads
      “Power” and “Plunder.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Traced among Prisoner 13’s tattoos are tiny magical sigils, each one
      matching a twin tattooed on one of her agents. A character who examines
      any visible tattoos and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)
      check notices some of the hidden marks. A character who succeeds on a DC
      15 Intelligence (Arcana) check determines that the sigils have something
      to do with minds or telepathy.
    </p>
    <h3 id="acquiring-the-key">Acquiring the Key</h3>
    <p>
      If she’s approached with the possibility of freedom, Prisoner 13 looks
      genuinely surprised but quickly assumes her usual neutral mask. Here’s how
      she responds to some likely questions:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What do you know about the vault and key?</strong> She plays coy:
      “I don’t know what you mean.” If pressed further, she shrugs. “I’ve been
      asked about this vault and key before. Assuming I did know where the key
      might be, what would be in it for me to tell you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Do you want to be set free?</strong> “As flattered as I am that
      you care, I’m afraid I must decline. I’m fine where I am, thanks.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What do you want for the key?</strong> She ponders for a moment
      before answering: “The warden has a ledger, probably in her office. It
      contains all the names, crimes, and prisoner numbers of everyone ever
      incarcerated at Revel’s End. Bring me that list, and I’ll see to it that
      you get your key.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to a verbal threat, Prisoner 13 shakes her head and says, “I
      could make quite a scene and bring the guards down on you. Maybe even the
      warden herself. You really don’t have anything to threaten me with.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Finding the Key.</strong> When Prisoner 13 talks about the key,
      each character present can make a DC 19 Wisdom (Insight) check. If the
      check is successful, the character notices Prisoner 13 flexing her right
      hand and tracing a fingertip across the tattoo there when she mentions the
      key. The character deduces that the tattoo is the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Forcible Jailbreak.</strong> Taking Prisoner 13 alive and
      delivering her to Varrin is difficult but possible. She won’t go willingly
      and fights back if the characters try to force her. In that case, they’ll
      be hard-pressed to knock her unconscious and make their escape without
      alarming the guards and placing the prison on high alert. If a fight
      breaks out with closed doors between the battle and the nearest guards, on
      initiative count 0, make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check for the guards
      to see if they notice the commotion. If they succeed, roll initiative for
      the guards. They investigate on the following round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Trade for the Key.</strong> If the characters acquire the prisoner
      files from the warden’s office (area R22), Prisoner 13 demands to read
      them somewhere outside her cell. She takes 20 minutes to read through the
      documents and telepathically relay the information to her agents for later
      use. Following that, she reveals that the tattoo on her right hand is the
      key to the vault. She allows the characters to study it so they can
      replicate its image using magic such as disguise self or minor illusion,
      or even copy it with pen and ink. In any case, a character must succeed on
      a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to correctly re-create the tattoo,
      which requires 10 minutes of study or drawing. The characters can retry if
      they fail, at the cost of more time and more risk of discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Last Resort.</strong> A gruesome but effective option is killing
      Prisoner 13 and taking her body back, or just her right hand. If the
      characters are working for the Golden Vault, they know the organization
      would not approve of this method. The characters receive no reward from
      the organization if they kill or mutilate Prisoner 13.
    </p>
    <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      When the characters successfully deliver the key (Prisoner 13’s keystone
      tattoo), Varrin’s joy and relief crack his usually reserved exterior, and
      he sends his agents to open the vault and reveal the lost Axebreaker
      treasure (he won’t allow the characters to be present for the vault
      opening). While much of the clan’s stolen wealth has been spent, there’s
      still a great fortune remaining. Varrin makes good on his bargain and
      gives a fair share to the characters as promised. The reward includes the
      following coins and gems (use the amounts in brackets if the characters
      negotiated a 5 percent fee):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>925 cp (972 cp)</li>
      <li>333 sp (350 sp)</li>
      <li>48 gp (51 gp)</li>
      <li>3 (4) bloodstones worth 10 gp each</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The characters can also choose one magic items from the following list, or
      two items if they successfully negotiated for a bigger reward from Varrin:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cap of water breathing</li>
      <li>Dust of disappearance</li>
      <li>Gem of brightness</li>
      <li>Mithral Half Plate (15+Dex no Stealth D/Adv)</li>
      <li>Potion of Goblin Climb</li>
      <li>Slippers of spider climbing</li>
    </ul>
