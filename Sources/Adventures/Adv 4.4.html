    <h2 id="adventure-background">Adventure Background</h2>
    <p>
      Prisoner 13 is a tiefling named Korda Glintstone. Prior to her
      incarceration years ago, Korda was an ally and agent of Clan Axebreaker, a
      moderately influential dwarf clan in a stronghold called Gauntlgrym. Korda
      built a network of informants and agents, ostensibly all to the benefit of
      Clan Axebreaker. With each success, she paid tattooists to inscribe a
      memorial of her triumph onto her skin. Using ancient rituals, Korda
      infused many of these artful etchings with the magic of Gauntlgrym’s
      forges, granting her wondrous gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Korda grew too ambitious for her role as an agent, so she devised a plan
      to take power for herself. Over five years she took careful stock of Clan
      Axebreaker’s wealth and, in one fell swoop, used her network of
      lieutenants to steal away most of the clan’s gold, leaving only a
      pittance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Axebreaker dwarves discovered her almost immediately. They rounded up
      her agents, who either fought to the death or were executed. They captured
      Korda and interrogated her, but she never revealed the location of the
      stolen fortune, even under magical compulsion. The Axebreaker dwarves used
      their influence to have her sentenced to life in prison at Revel’s End.
      There, Clan Axebreaker was hopeful Korda would eventually break and reveal
      the location of the stolen wealth. This played right into Korda’s hands,
      since she had made copious enemies who can’t move against her while she’s
      incarcerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Korda, now known as Prisoner 13, prepared for her imprisonment by laying
      the groundwork for a new spy and criminal network, which cost her much of
      her stolen fortune. She now runs her operations from the prison. Using her
      magical tattoos, she telepathically coordinates agents throughout Faerûn
      and beyond, none of whom know the identity of their employer. As for what
      remains of the stolen Axebreaker wealth, it rests in an unmarked vault in
      the depths of Gauntlgrym, sealed by a magical lock that only the runic
      sequence tattooed on Korda’s right hand can open.

    <p>
      After years of financial hardship due to their stolen fortune, the
      mountain dwarves of Clan Axebreaker have located the lost treasure but
      have been unable to access it. They however, are not the only ones, An old
      agent of Korda has also found it and wishes to hire the characters to
      learn how to access the treasure. <strong>Varrin</strong> Learned of the
      characters through the theives guild, as two of the party have had recent
      interactions. They have been highly recommended as the type who get things
      done.
    </p>
    <h2 id="varrins-proposition">Varrin’s Proposition</h2>
    <p>
      Varrin (lawful good, tiefling
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Noble.png">noble</a>)
      contacted the characters to enlist their aid in retrieving the key.
      Varrin’s braided hair is black with streaks of gray. He wears a loose,
      comfortable robe over a steel breastplate. Whether Varrin approaches the
      characters or invites them to a meeting, read the following text:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Thank you for hearing me out. My name is Varrin, and I have a
        proposition for you. The Axbreaker clan, my old allies, have located
        wealth stolen from them many years ago, but it’s sealed in a vault
        that’s magically locked. If you can recover the key—whatever it is—we
        can unlock the vault and I can finally claim the treasure that is
        rightfully mine. I’ll cut you in for a percentage of the recovered
        treasure, of course.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        “The catch here is Korda is the only person who knows how to open the
        vault, and she is currently rotting away in the prison of Revel’s End.
        She's proved uncooperative in the past, but as the dwarves and myself
        have recently discovered the vault where she hid what she stole. I need
        you to question her and learn how to open the vault. How you do that is
        up to you; if you need to spring her from the prison in exchange for
        this information, please do so. I can provide you with a way in, as well
        as the layout of Revel’s End and a few useful tricks.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Give the players a copy of map, and read the following text:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Varrin retrieves a faceted sapphire the size of a small orange and
        places it on the table. He waves his hand over the gem, and a glowing
        blue image of a building floor plan appears in the air above it. He taps
        the gem, and the image vanishes. The sapphire splits into sections, and
        he passes one fragment to each of you. The fragment grows warm in your
        hand, melts, then vanishes, leaving a warm, tingling sensation behind.
        “Think about the map of Revel’s End, and you’ll be able to see it.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The gem’s magic lasts until five days after the characters reach Revel’s
      End.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-breakers-map">The Breaker’s Map</h2>
    <p>
      Each character can now cause a magical image of map 4.1 to appear in the
      air before them while they aren’t incapacitated (no action required). A
      breaker’s map isn’t visible to others while a character is viewing it.
      Varrin explains each of the features the characters can see on their maps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Cells</strong> The cells, highlighted in red, are blanketed in
        permanent antimagic. <strong>Prisoner 13</strong>'s cell is clearly
        marked.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Doors and Hatches</strong> The doors and hatches are sealed with
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Arcane Lock.png"
          >arcane lock</a
        >
        spells that only prison staff can bypass. However, while the characters
        are within 100 feet of Revel's End, the map allows them to use an action
        to touch the image of a door or hatch and suppress the lock on that
        portal. While a lock is suppressed, its image turns green. The lock
        remains suppressed for 1 minute or until another lock is suppressed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Patrol Route</strong> The yellow path marked on the map is the
        regular patrol route guards take. The usual patrol rotation is once
        every 20 minutes, but if the guards are suspicious, patrols will likely
        become more frequent.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="the-devil-in-the-details">The Devil in the Details</h3>
    <p>
      In the likely event that the characters want more information, Varrin
      answers their questions succinctly and honestly. He has spent the last of
      his personal fortune gathering information on the prison and making the
      arrangements for a team to confront Korda. These are the details he can
      provide:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Entering the Prison</strong> The prison staff rotate out
        periodically. Varrin knows the schedule of the next rotation, and his
        agents are standing by to capture a number of guards and cooks so the
        characters can take their place (see &quot;Approaching the
        Prison&quot;).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> was a trusted
        agent of Clan Axebreaker until she betrayed the clan and stole its
        fortune. If pressed, Varrin reluctantly tells the characters her name
        (Korda Glintstone), but he stresses that they shouldn't reveal they know
        it. No one in the prison except perhaps the warden knows
        <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> by her real name, so using it would only
        raise suspicion. Her cell is marked on the map.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Key</strong> <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> must have the vault
        key or know where it is, but every magical method Clan Axebreaker has
        tried to locate the key has failed. Varrin presumes
        <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> would give up the key only in exchange for
        freedom, but if the characters can find the key or convince her to give
        it up any other way, he'll be just as pleased. Clan Axebreaker tried to
        arrange her release, but the Absolution Council at Revel's End denied
        the request.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Meeting Prisoner 13</strong> Visitors can request meetings with
        prisoners, but those meetings are always supervised by the warden (to
        learn about the warden, see &quot;R21: Warden's Quarters&quot;). If the
        characters want to talk to <strong>Prisoner 13</strong>, their best bet
        is to try when she's not in her cell, hopefully out of sight of the
        guards. Prisoners do chores such as emptying latrine buckets and
        cleaning up after meals, and they exercise in the courtyard daily. When
        prisoners are injured or fall ill, they are taken to the prison
        hospital.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Revel's End Details</strong> Varrin can give a general overview
        of Revel's End, the security features on doors and hatches, and the
        prison's high-alert procedure (see below). Varrin also knows the armory
        has a dangerous guardian, but he doesn't know the details.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Treasure</strong> The treasure is locked in a vault deep beneath
        the dwarf stronghold of Gauntlgrym. Varrin promises the characters 2
        percent of whatever treasure they recover if they make it possible for
        him to open the vault. If the characters press for more, Varrin is
        irritated, but he agrees to 3 percent if the characters succeed on a DC
        20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Varrin notes that the warden likely has
        some funds hidden in her office or quarters, if the characters are
        inclined to seek these out.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Escape Route</strong> Varrin will have a small ship within sight
        of the prison but at a safe distance. When the characters are ready to
        leave the prison with their target, they can shine a light from the dock
        after dark, and the ship will pick them up.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When the characters are ready to depart from their meeting with Varrin, he
      provides them each with the choice to pose as a guard or a cook. Guards
      must wear splint armor, and kitchen staff must wear simple uniforms. Cooks
      can hide light armor under their uniforms. Small characters also have the
      option to stow away inside a crate of supplies.
    </p>
    <h1 id="trek-to-the-prison">Trek to the Prison</h1>
    <p>
      Varrin has sent word to his agents, and Bethra (chaotic good, tiefling
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Spy.png">spy</a>) meets
      the characters when they arrive in Luskan. She provides the uniforms for
      their chosen cover and directs them to report to a ship called the Jolly
      Pelican the following dawn. The ship regularly delivers a fresh rotation
      of prison staff to Revel's End and returns the relieved shift to the Sword
      Coast. The journey to Revel's End by sea is 350 miles, which a sailing
      ship can cover in three days under normal conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-five guards and six cooks are bound for the prison, including any
      characters taking their places. If the characters express concern over the
      fate of staff they're replacing, Bethra assures them that none of the
      people were killed, and they'll be released safely when the job is over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The players can make up whatever names they like for their cover. Those
      are the names of the guards or cooks they've replaced.
    </p>
    <h2 id="revels-end">Revel's End</h2>
    <p>
      Revel's End is a panopticon, a prison configured in such a way that the
      activities of the prisoners can be closely monitored from a central
      location. Situated on the frigid, misty coast of the Sea of Moving Ice,
      the prison is a single-story structure topped with battlements. Rising
      from the core of the panopticon is a tower that holds the prison's
      administrative offices and guard barracks. Both the prison and the tower
      are carved from a tall, blade-shaped rock that rises high above the sea
      cliffs. This rock, called the Windbreak, shields the tower against the
      brutal winds that sweep down from the Reghed Glacier.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can approach Revel's End by land, sea, or air. A pier allows prisoners
      to be taken from ships up an elevator to the prison, and a mooring dock at
      the top of the tower allows prisoners to be delivered by airship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revel's End is controlled by the Lords' Alliance, a loose confederation of
      settlements whose current members include the cities of Baldur's Gate,
      Mirabar, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, and Yartar; the towns of
      Amphail, Daggerford, and Longsaddle; and the dwarven stronghold of Mithral
      Hall. To be imprisoned in Revel's End, one must have committed a serious
      crime against one or more of the member cities and been sentenced to a
      lengthy period of incarceration (typically a year or more).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each member of the Lords' Alliance assigns one representative to Revel's
      End, and together the representatives form a parole committee called the
      Absolution Council. Rarely are all ten council members present, since
      Revel's End offers little in the way of comfort and amenities. If the
      council needs a tiebreaking vote to determine whether to commute a
      prisoner's sentence, the prison warden—a neutral arbiter with no ties to
      any Lords' Alliance member—casts the deciding vote.
    </p>
    <h3 id="prison-features">Prison Features</h3>
    <p>
      The prison, hewn from stone, has 20-foot-high outer walls and flat,
      20-foot-high ceilings throughout. Additional information about the prison
      is summarized below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Doors and Hatches</strong> Each door and rooftop hatch is made
        of reinforced iron held shut by an
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Arcane Lock.png"
          >arcane lock</a
        >
        spell. Prison personnel can open these doors and hatches normally. A
        locked door or hatch is too strong to be shouldered or kicked open, but
        it can be destroyed if it takes enough damage. A door or hatch has AC
        19, a damage threshold of 10, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and
        psychic damage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Heating</strong> Interior spaces are magically heated. The
        temperature in these areas is a constant 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20
        degrees Celsius). The exterior of the prison, including the guard
        towers, is 0 degrees Fahrenheit (−18 degrees Celsius) or colder.
        Creatures outside the prison are exposed to extreme cold (see below).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lighting</strong> Unless a location states otherwise, the
        courtyard, corridors, rooms, and staircases are brightly lit with
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Continual Flame.png"
          >continual flame</a
        >
        spells cast on wall sconces. (The unlit cells in area R17 are
        exceptions.) In some locations, the magical lights can be dimmed or
        suppressed, as noted in the text.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prison Guards</strong> The prison has a garrison of 75 guards
        (use the
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Veteran.png"
          >veteran</a
        >
        stat block) who work eight-hour shifts. Two-thirds of the garrison is
        off duty and resting in area R19 at any given time. While on duty, each
        guard wears a tunic that bears the Lords' Alliance emblem: a gold crown
        on a red field.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prisoners</strong> All prisoners in Revel's End are identified
        by a number. This simple protocol keeps prisoners on an equal footing.
        Prison personnel commit these numbers to memory, and the records of all
        prisoners—past and present—are stored in area R22. Each inmate wears a
        uniform that consists of a hoodless robe without pockets, leather
        slippers without laces, and cloth undergarments. While outside their
        cells, prisoners wear manacles on their wrists and ankles. While
        manacled, a prisoner's walking speed can't exceed 10 feet.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="approaching-the-prison">Approaching the Prison</h3>
    <p>When the characters approach the prison, read the following text:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Perched on a high cliff overlooking the Sea of Moving Ice is a bleak
        stone fortress carved from a gigantic, blade-shaped rock. A central
        tower looms above the rest of the fortress, and light leaks from its
        arrow slits. Four smaller towers rise from the outermost corners of the
        fortress, and guards can be seen atop them.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Characters might approach the prison via the Jolly Pelican, or they might
      choose to approach on their own (see &quot;Getting Inside&quot; below).
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters approaching from the north can also see the prison's northern
      entrance at the top of a 160-foot-high cliff with a pier protruding from
      its base. A giant wooden crane stands nearby, and a wooden scaffold clings
      to the cliff face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters approaching from the south can see the prison's south entrance
      and the trail that leads up to it.
    </p>
    <h3 id="guards-on-watch">Guards on Watch</h3>
    <p>
      The prison has four guard towers (see area R9), and three guards in
      cold-weather clothing are stationed atop each one. If you need to make
      Wisdom (Perception) checks for the guards to determine if they notice
      something, make only one roll with advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the guards on a tower see or hear something out of the ordinary—such as
      an approaching ship, a group of visitors, or a monster flying overhead—one
      guard descends into the tower to alert the rest of the prison while the
      others stay at their posts.
    </p>
    <h3 id="getting-inside">Getting Inside</h3>
    <p>
      If the characters use the cover Varrin provided, their ship arrives at
      Revel’s End just before dawn, three days after leaving Gullet Cove. The
      characters are directed off the ship, ride the elevator to the cliff top,
      and are admitted through the front doors. Characters posing as guards are
      taken to the barracks (area R19), where they meet with head guard Yula
      Dargeria, a no-nonsense stickler for the prison’s rules. Characters posing
      as cooks are delivered to the kitchen (area R8), where they report to Chef
      Tiny Toulaine, a hulking, jovial man who carries an enormous saucepan
      instead of a heavy crossbow. Small characters who stowed away in supply
      crates are taken to either the storeroom (area R13), the kitchen’s cold
      storage room (the middle room off area R8), or the pantry (the
      northernmost room off area R8). If more than one Small character stows
      away, pick one location where they’re all delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters who bang on the prison’s north or south door are admitted into
      a 30-foot-long corridor, where they are greeted by the three guards from a
      nearby guard room (area R3). These guards insist on confiscating the
      characters’ weapons and storing them in a nearby lockbox. In addition, one
      guard searches each character for concealed weapons. A character can
      conceal a dagger or similarly sized weapon from a guard’s notice with a
      successful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the characters have sled dogs or pack animals, a guard grants the party
      access to the stables (area R5), where the animals can be kept safe.
      Animals aren’t allowed in the prison otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      After relinquishing their weapons and securing their animals, the
      characters are escorted by one of the guards to the meeting room (area
      R12), where they must wait one hour for the warden to greet them. During
      this time, the characters are unattended and can attempt to sneak into the
      prison at large. Doing so without alerting the guards requires a
      successful DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check. Recovering the characters’
      weapons from the lockbox requires a successful DC 16 Dexterity check with
      thieves’ tools. If the characters are caught attempting either of these
      tasks, the guards return them to the meeting room and wait with them for
      the warden, who throws them out unless they provide a satisfactory reason
      for their visit and subterfuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warden only accepts the characters’ presence if they are seeking
      shelter. In that case, she grants them temporary accommodations (in area
      R7) for up to two days and two nights, and the characters receive three
      meals a day during their stay. If the characters fail to provide a
      satisfactory reason for their visit, the warden has their weapons and
      animals returned to them before throwing them out.
    </p>
    <h2 id="patrol-routes">Patrol Routes</h2>
    <p>
      Guards regularly patrol in pairs from the guard rooms (area R3,
      alternating which room for each patrol) around the hexagon (area R15),
      with short checks into the courtyard (area R11) and the armory (area R10).
      The route is marked in yellow on the players’ map of Revel’s End. It
      normally takes 4 minutes for a patrol to make its round and return to its
      post.
    </p>
    <p>
      When one or more characters enter an area marked on the patrol route, roll
      a die. The size of the die rolled is determined by the current suspicion
      level of the prison, as indicated on the Suspicion table. On a 1, the
      characters encounter a patrol. Ask the players how their characters react,
      and give them 1 round of actions. The characters can try to slip away if
      there is a nearby exit or corner to duck around by making a group
      Dexterity (Stealth) check or try to blend in by making a group Charisma
      (Deception) check. Each check is made against a DC set by the current
      suspicion level. On a failure, the patrol notices the characters, who must
      account for their presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the characters try to talk their way past a patrol, have one of the
      characters make a Charisma check using Deception, Intimidation, or
      Persuasion, depending on their story, against a DC set by the suspicion
      level. If other characters support the story, the check is made with
      advantage. On a success, the patrol lets them go. On a failure, the patrol
      escorts the characters to a guard room (area R3), where the guard
      interrogates the characters about the characters’ presence in a prohibited
      area. If the characters have a cover story for being in the prison, the
      guards escort them to where they should be: the kitchen staff’s quarters
      (the largest side room off area R8) or the barracks (area R19) in the case
      of off-duty guards. The suspicion level then increases by 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the characters encounter a patrol, don’t check for another patrol
      when the characters enter the route until 20 minutes have passed.

    <h3 id="r1-dock">R1: Dock</h3>
    <p>
      Ships dock here to offload prisoners and supplies. The sea is rough
      virtually all the time, and with the spray of the sea, along with the wind
      chill, no one wants to stand here for too long.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r2-elevator">R2: Elevator</h3>
    <p>
      A sturdy wooden scaffold clings to the 160-foot-high cliff separating the
      prison from the dock. Looming above the scaffolding is a wooden crane that
      is controlled from area R3. The crane raises and lowers an elevator car
      that has a retractable wooden gate on the side opposite the crane. The
      elevator car is a hollow wooden cube measuring 10 feet on each side. It
      takes 1 minute for the car to travel all the way up or down the scaffold.
      The entire time the sound of the wood groans and creaks. None of these
      sounds are in the least bit reassuring.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r3-guard-rooms">R3: Guard Rooms</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This room contains a table with four chairs, and a cabinet holding
        whetstones and other simple supplies for repairing armor and weapons. It
        is a simple room, there is minimal decoration inside. This is also where
        you can find the controls for the elevator.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Three guards (<a
        href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Veteran.png"
        >veterans</a
      >) are stationed in each of these two rooms. The guards pass the time by
      playing cards, sharpening their weapons, and complaining about the
      weather. Which as per usual, is cold, damp and miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Embedded in the north wall of the northern guard room is an iron lever
      that raises and lowers the elevator in area R2. During a patrol, two of
      the guards leave the room to make their rounds for 4 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r4-hospital">R4: Hospital</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This chamber contains a dozen simple beds. Cabinets along the north wall
        hold medical supplies.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The cabinets hold enough supplies to assemble twenty
      <em>healer's kits</em>, five vials of <em>antitoxin</em>, and various
      other medicines and tinctures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these substances are poisonous if ingested in the wrong
      proportion. A character proficient with alchemist’s supplies, a poisoner’s
      kit, an herbalist’s kit, or the Medicine skill can identify the tinctures
      and combine them into an ingested poison. A creature that ingests the
      poison must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving
      throw, it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage and becomes poisoned for 1 hour. On
      a successful saving throw, it takes half as much damage and isn’t
      poisoned. In either case, the creature has painful stomach cramps until it
      finishes a short rest, drinks a vial of antitoxin, or is targeted by an
      effect that ends the poisoned condition. If a prisoner suffers these
      cramps, the guards bring the prisoner to the hospital to be examined and
      treated. Characters disguised as guards can volunteer for or be assigned
      that duty.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r5-stables">R5: Stables</h3>
    <p>
      Visitors who bring mounts, sled dogs, pack animals, or pets to Revel’s End
      can keep their animals here. The prison doesn’t supply food for animals,
      however. Currently the stables are empty, but the smell of animal waste is
      pungent. You imagine this area has not been cleaned for a long time,
      coupled with the constant damp and wet weather makes for a rather
      unpleasant space.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r6-mess-hall">R6: Mess Hall</h3>
    <p>
      Prison personnel dine here. Tables and benches fill the room, and dishes
      and dulled cutlery are stored in cabinets along the south wall. The mess
      hall serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The characters can meet here
      without arousing any suspicion. The walls are lined with some very old
      looking candle brackets, each one lit by the
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Continual Flame.png"
        >continual flame</a
      >
      spells that can be suppressed or activated by uttering the command word,
      “lights.”
    </p>
    <h3 id="r7-councilors-quarters">R7: Councilors’ Quarters</h3>
    <p>
      These ten rooms are furnished identically. Each contains a bed, a desk
      with matching chair, a claw-footed chest, and wall hooks for hanging
      clothes. The
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Continual Flame.png"
        >continual flame</a
      >
      spell that illuminates each room can be suppressed or returned to its
      normal light level by uttering the command word, “lights.”
    </p>
    <p>
      These rooms are set aside for the ten members of the Absolution Council,
      though only three rooms are currently in use. The other seven members of
      the council are absent, so the warden lets visitors use the spare rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Council Members.</em></strong> These three members of the
      Absolution Council are at Revel's End:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Councilor Voss Anderton</strong> Voss represents the city of
        Neverwinter. He is a lawful neutral, human noncombatant who has a
        precise, lawyerly way of speaking. He never misses a council meeting or
        parole hearing. He votes with his head, not his heart, and he always
        weighs the ramifications of commuting a prisoner's sentence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Councilor Jil Torbo</strong> Jil represents the city of Baldur's
        Gate. She is a neutral, halfling noncombatant who loathes her job. She
        has no sense of humor and sighs deeply when her patience is tested. She
        likes giving others the benefit of the doubt, however—perhaps as an act
        of dissent—and votes yes on commutations more often than not.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Councilor Kriv Norixius</strong> Kriv represents the town of
        Daggerford. He is a lawful good, dragonborn noncombatant of silver
        dragon ancestry. He hopes to impress the Duchess of Daggerford by doing
        a good job. He has no tolerance for unrepentant criminals and often
        votes no on commutations.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="r8-kitchen-and-side-rooms">R8: Kitchen and Side Rooms</h3>
    <p>
      Six cooks (neutral,
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Commoner.png"
        >commoners</a
      >s) take shifts here, working in pairs to produce meals for the prisoners
      and staff. The kitchen contains everything one would expect to see, as
      well as an iron stove and a pump that draws water from a magically heated
      cistern on the roof. Off-duty cooks sleep in the largest of the three
      rooms west of the kitchen. This side room is lit by
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Continual Flame.png"
        >continual flame</a
      >
      spells that can be suppressed or activated by uttering the command word,
      “lights.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The middle side room—not heated, unlike the rest of the prison—is used for
      cold storage. The smallest side room is a well-stocked pantry.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r9-guard-towers">R9: Guard Towers</h3>
    <p>
      Each of these four triangular towers is two stories tall. A tower's
      interior chamber is empty except for a wooden ladder that climbs to an
      iron hatch held shut by an
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Arcane Lock.png"
        >arcane lock</a
      >
      spell (see the &quot;Prison Features&quot; section for more details). This
      hatch leads to the tower's flat rooftop, which is lined with battlements.
      Three Lords' Alliance guards (<a
        href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Veteran.png"
        >veterans</a
      >) in cold-weather clothing are stationed on the roof of each tower.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r10-armory">R10: Armory</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This room contains wooden racks and chests filled with weaponry.
        Floating in the middle of the room is a spherical creature with a large
        central eye and four writhing eyestalks.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The inventory is nonmagical and includes twenty <em>halberds</em>, fifteen
      <em>longswords</em>, fifteen <em>shortswords</em>, ten <em>pikes</em>, ten
      <em>heavy crossbows</em>, five <em>light crossbows</em>, and hundreds of
      <em>crossbow bolts</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The armory is guarded by a
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Spectator.png"
        >spectator</a
      >

    <p>
      This courtyard is paved with flagstones, which are covered with drifting
      snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the weather allows, prisoners are brought here—individually or in
      small groups—for fresh air and exercise. They are watched closely by
      guards on the ground as well as the guards on the corner tower. Characters
      can speak quietly with a prisoner without being noticed from the tower.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r12-meeting-room">R12: Meeting Room</h3>
    <p>
      This room holds a large, rectangular table with a single chair on one long
      side and three similar chairs on the opposite side. The room is used for
      meetings with prisoners or the warden.

    <h3 id="r13-storeroom">R13: Storeroom</h3>
    <p>
      Supplies are stored here in crates and other containers. At present, the
      prison has stockpiled enough necessities to continue operations for six
      months. It is mostly food, but if you look closely you may find that there
      is a small stash of alcohol. This seems to have been smuggled here by a
      few of the guards, to make the cold dark nights slightly more enjoyable.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r14-privy">R14: Privy</h3>
    <p>
      This room contains a dozen wooden waste buckets. Once per day, usually in
      the morning, manacled prisoners carry the buckets outside the prison and
      dispose of the waste while watched by guards.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r15-hexagon">R15: Hexagon</h3>
    <p>
      This corridor allows guards and visitors to access the outermost rooms of
      the prison while avoiding the panopticon (area R16) and its prison cells
      (area R17). The guards refer to this corridor as “the hexagon” because of
      its shape.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r16-panopticon">R16: Panopticon</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This hexagonal chamber is a large open space at the center of the
        prison. Cells line the chamber walls, and a smaller hexagonal room
        occupies the center of the space.
      </p>

        >continual flame</a

      spells that light this area can be dimmed from the surveillance hub (area
      R18). The hall is dimly lit at night.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r17-cells">R17: Cells</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Each cell is enclosed by formidable steel bars. Bolted to the back wall
        are iron bunk beds, each with a thin mattress. A waste bucket sits near
        the beds.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The prisoners are kept in these unlit cells (effectively illuminated by
      the lights in R16) behind barred gates that can be opened only from area
      R18. The gates are too secure to be forced open using brute strength or
      weapons, and magical attempts to open or bypass them are thwarted by
      permanent antimagic fields. Each field encompasses one cell and its gate.
      Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a
      deity, are suppressed in an antimagic field and can’t protrude into it.
      While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends
      suppressed counts against its duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bolted to the back wall of each cell is an iron bunk bed with thin
      mattresses and a waste bucket nearby. Prisoners take their meals in their
      cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Prisoners.</em></strong> Each of the twenty-four cells can
      hold one or two prisoners. There are 11 prisoners currently within Revel's
      End. Numbers are assigned in the order in which the prisoners arrive and
      are never reused. The longest-serving prisoner currently incarcerated at
      Revel’s End is Prisoner 6, and the newest one is Prisoner 299.
      <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> (see the “Roleplaying Prisoner 13” section
      later in this adventure for more details) has no cellmate. Her cell is
      marked on <em>map 4.1</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add detail to other inmates, roll on the Prisoners table or choose
      entries you like. If a prisoner’s game statistics become necessary, choose
      an appropriate stat block from the <em>Monster Manual</em>, and remove
      armor, weapons, and other gear.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This hexagonal room is the base of the prison’s central tower. A spiral
        staircase rises to the tower’s upper levels. Several guards watch
        through the arrow slits, observing the cells, while one sits at a metal
        desk and console with a myriad of switches and dials and a brass tube
        with a funnel-like flare.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The stairs lead to areas R19 through R23. Seven guards (<a
        href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Veteran.png"
        >veterans</a
      >) are stationed in this surveillance hub. One sits at a console south of
      the staircase. The other guards watch the prisoners through 4-foot-tall,
      1-foot-wide arrow slits in the walls. Hanging on the walls between the
      arrow slits are fifty sets of iron manacles guards use to bind prisoners'
      wrists and ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Console.</em></strong> The console is a magical device that
      resembles a desk with a slanted top and is bolted to the floor. It is a
      Large object with AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic
      damage. The console has the following magical properties, which are
      disabled if it is reduced to 0 hit points:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Gate Control</strong> Twenty-four switches on the console open
        and close the gates to the prison cells. A master switch opens or closes
        all the gates at once. Flipping one or more switches on the console
        requires an action.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Light Control</strong> A brass dial on the console controls the
        light level in area R16. Turning the dial requires an action or a bonus
        action.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Loudspeaker</strong> As an action, a creature can use this
        device, which resembles the bell of a trumpet, to broadcast its voice
        throughout the prison.

        A door in the spiral staircase leads into a large room filled with
        wooden bunk beds. There are arrow slits in the north, west, and south
        walls. Footlockers and armor racks accompany each bed. The spiral stairs
        continue up past the door.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Characters who climb the spiral staircase come to a door 100 feet above
      the prison roof. The staircase continues beyond this door to the tower’s
      higher levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opens into a room filled with wooden bunk beds. Areas to the
      north, west, and south can be viewed through 4-foot-tall, 1-foot-wide
      arrow slits. The
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Continual Flame.png"

      spells that light the room can be dimmed or brightened by uttering the
      command word, “lights.”

    <p>
      When the prison isn’t on high alert, fifty guards (<a
        href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Veteran.png"
        >veterans</a
      >
      without armor or weapons) sleep in the bunks. The guards keep their armor
      and weapons within easy reach. They keep other belongings in unlocked
      footlockers tucked under their bunk beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guards need 10 minutes to don their armor. If the prison is put on
      high alert, the guards take the time to put on their armor before making
      their way down to area R18.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r20-hall-of-absolution">R20: Hall of Absolution</h3>
    <p>
      The floor of this room is 120 feet above the prison roof. A spiral
      staircase connects the room to the other levels of the tower (area R18 is
      140 feet down, area R19 is 20 feet down, and area R23 is 20 feet up).
      Narrow windows line the outer walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long, slightly curved table with eleven chairs takes up much of the
      room. The middle chair has no special adornments, while the others have
      banners hanging over their high backs, each one emblazoned with the crest
      of a Lords’ Alliance member. Banners hanging on the walls display the
      alliance’s emblem: a golden crown on a red field.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Absolution Council Meetings.</em></strong> Members of the
      Absolution Council gather here to weigh the merits of releasing prisoners
      whom one or more council members have recommended for parole. No prisoner
      can receive such consideration more than once a year. Prisoners up for
      parole are brought to this room in manacles and given a chance to sway the
      council members before votes are cast. The warden (see area R21), who
      always attends such meetings, sits in the middle chair and casts the
      tiebreaking vote, if necessary.

    <p>
      <strong><em>Prison Warden.</em></strong> The calm and unflappable warden
      of Revel’s End is Marta Marthannis, a lawful good, human <em>mage</em> who
      speaks Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, and Orc. She wears a red robe with gold
      trim and keeps a ring with seven tiny keys hanging from it in one pocket.
      One key unlocks the warden’s chest (see “Treasure” below); the others
      unlock the desk drawer and the cabinets in the warden’s office (area R22).
    </p>
    <p>
      Warden Marthannis is secretly a member of the Harpers, a faction that
      works behind the scenes to keep power out of the hands of evildoers. In
      her current position, she works to keep some of the Sword Coast’s worst
      malefactors behind bars. So far, the warden has managed to conceal her
      Harper affiliation from everyone else in the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Marthannis’s Possession.</em></strong> Unlike her membership
      in the Harpers, Marthannis hasn’t concealed the fact that she is
      periodically possessed. Lodged inside her is the spirit of a deceased
      adventuring companion: a lawful good, shield dwarvish fighter named Vlax
      Brawnanvil. The spirit of Vlax takes control of Warden Marthannis once or
      twice a day, each time for an hour or two—though never while she’s
      performing important duties, such as supervising prisoner meetings with
      visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      While under Vlax’s control, the warden can’t cast her prepared spells or
      use the command word for high alert (see the “High Alert“ section), speaks
      only Dwarvish, and occasionally indulges Vlax’s vice for ale and spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warden Marthannis knows that to rid herself of Vlax’s spirit, she must
      visit the Brawnanvil crypts in Gauntlgrym, a dwarven fortress under Mount
      Hotenow (near Neverwinter), where the spirits of Vlax’s kin can persuade
      Vlax to join them in the afterlife. The warden refuses to make the
      journey, however, because she can’t bear to lose all contact with Vlax.
      The warden has made her state known to the prison guards and Absolution
      Council members, and they have grown accustomed to her personality changes
      and bouts of revelry. The possession hasn’t affected the warden’s ability
      to carry out her duties, and so far, no one has questioned her fitness for
      her job.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Among the chamber’s furnishings is a
      locked wooden chest, for which the warden carries the only key. A
      character using thieves’ tools can use an action to try to pick the lock,
      doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chest holds a set of <em>calligrapher’s supplies</em>, a
      <em>sack</em> containing 750 sp (money that’s used mainly to pay ship
      captains who drop off prisoners and cargo), and a silver cloak pin (25 sp)
      bearing the symbol of the Harpers: a tiny harp nestled between the horns
      of a crescent moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any character who searches the chest for secret compartments finds one in
      the lid. It holds a <em>wand of binding</em> that the warden keeps for
      emergencies.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r22-office">R22: Office</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        A heavy desk stands in the middle of the room with parchment, quills,
        and ink at the ready. Five heavy wood cabinets line the east wall.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Prison records are stored here in the locked cabinets. The cabinets also
      contain ship cargo manifests and records of past deliveries, as well as
      prisoner transfer orders and a ledger documenting the names, crimes,
      sentences, and commutations of every prisoner who has been incarcerated at
      Revel’s End. The records include death certificates for prisoners who died
      while incarcerated. The cause of death is always given as “natural,”
      “accidental,” or “unnatural,” with no details.
    </p>
    <p>
      A desk in the middle of the room has ten financial ledgers packed into a
      locked side drawer. The keys for the desk and the cabinets are in the
      warden’s possession. A character with thieves’ tools can use an action to
      try to pick the lock on the desk drawer or one of the cabinets, doing so
      with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check.
    </p>
    <h3 id="r23-tower-roof">R23: Tower Roof</h3>
    <p>
      This flat rooftop is 140 feet above the prison roof and 300 feet above sea
      level. Three 6-foot-high walls to the north, southwest, and southeast
      provide limited cover, but much of the rooftop is exposed to the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wooden drawbridge can be lowered on one side to create an airship dock.
      An action is required to raise or lower the drawbridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      No guards are stationed here. If the guards in the prison watchtowers
      (area R9) see an airship or an airborne threat approaching Revel’s End,
      they alert the rest of the prison. The warden then dons cold-weather
      clothing and heads to the roof to greet the airship crew or deal with the
      airborne threat herself.
    </p>
    <h1 id="prisoner-13">Prisoner 13</h1>
    <p>
      The first time the characters encounter <em>Prisoner 13</em>, read the
      following:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This tightly muscled tiefling woman keeps her red hair cut short. Her
        bronze skin is covered in tattoos that stretch from her collarbone to
        her ankles. She surveys you with unimpressed eyes.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> is a cunning schemer, ruthless and patient.
      She listens and watches, absorbing every detail she can, and shares as
      little as she can get away with.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> is comfortable with her lot in life, enjoying
      the anonymity and ironic protection of Revel's End like a warm blanket on
      a winter night. While confined to her antimagic cell, she is cautious
      since she can't rely on her magic tattoos to defend herself. Outside her
      cell, she grows overly confident and even banters if she's able to do so
      without being caught by guards. In battle she poses a potent threat,
      creating blasts of flame and striking with magical force in both melee and
      ranged combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spends her time contemplating the web of schemes she learns through
      the eyes, ears, and hands of her agents outside the prison. While outside
      her cell during daily exercise in the courtyard or during chores, she
      contacts her agents for updates and makes arrangements that keep her
      network running.

      Most of <strong>Prisoner 13’s</strong> inkwork is covered by her uniform.
      Her tattoos include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Tiefling Poetry.</strong> An excerpt from a poem in Infernal
        script on her neck and across her shoulder blades reads, “Endless dreams

        <strong>Shroud</strong> Black and gray smoke and shadows coil down her
        left arm, ending in runes on the fingers of her left hand.

        <strong>Knotwork</strong> Purple and blue knotwork and runes run down
        her right arm, across the back of her right hand, and down the length of
        each finger. The runes on her fingers, known as the keystone tattoo,
        form the key to the vault in Gauntlgrym. The characters must acquire
        this key to complete their mission (see &quot;Acquiring the Key&quot;
        below).

      Traced among <strong>Prisoner 13</strong>'s tattoos are tiny magical
      sigils, each one matching a twin tattooed on one of her agents. A
      character who examines any visible tattoos and succeeds on a DC 15
      Intelligence (Investigation) check notices some of the hidden marks. A
      character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check determines
      that the sigils have something to do with minds or telepathy.

    <p>
      If she’s approached with the possibility of freedom,
      <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> looks genuinely surprised but quickly assumes
      her usual neutral mask. Here’s how she responds to some likely questions:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Why did you steal from the dwarves?</strong> She spits a little
      venom and says: “Its perfectly simple, they deserved it. I worked with
      them, to build that wealth, watched as they tore through a goblin
      settlement, needlessly killing. Watched as they hunted the drow, schemed
      against the elves and hoarded wealth like dragons. But then they turned on
      my own people, their own allies who helped them build this wealth. For
      years i planted my own people in their organisation, my luetenants if you
      will, and when the time was right we took it all. But sadly i was caught,
      tortured, and sent here to rot.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What do you know about the vault and key?</strong> She plays coy:
      &quot;I don't know what you mean.&quot; If pressed further, she shrugs.
      &quot;I've been asked about this vault and key before. Assuming I did know
      where the key might be, what would be in it for me to tell you?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Do you want to be set free?</strong> &quot;As flattered as I am
      that you care, I'm afraid I must decline. I'm fine where I am,
      thanks.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What do you want for the key?</strong> She ponders for a moment
      before answering: &quot;The warden has a ledger, probably in her office.
      It contains all the names, crimes, and prisoner numbers of everyone ever
      incarcerated at Revel's End. Bring me that list, and I'll see to it that
      you get your key.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to a verbal threat, <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> shakes her
      head and says, &quot;I could make quite a scene and bring the guards down
      on you. Maybe even the warden herself. You really don't have anything to
      threaten me with.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Finding the Key.</em></strong> When
      <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> talks about the key, each character present
      can make a DC 19 Wisdom (Insight) check. If the check is successful, the
      character notices <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> flexing her right hand and
      tracing a fingertip across the tattoo there when she mentions the key. The
      character deduces that the tattoo is the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Forcible Jailbreak.</em></strong> Taking
      <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> alive and delivering her to Varrin is
      difficult but possible. She won't go willingly and fights back if the
      characters try to force her. In that case, they'll be hard-pressed to
      knock her unconscious and make their escape without alarming the guards
      and placing the prison on high alert. If a fight breaks out with closed
      doors between the battle and the nearest guards, on initiative count 0,
      make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check for the guards to see if they
      notice the commotion. If they succeed, roll initiative for the guards.
      They investigate on the following round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Trade for the Key.</em></strong> If the characters acquire the
      prisoner files from the warden's office (area R22),
      <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> demands to read them somewhere outside her
      cell. She takes 20 minutes to read through the documents and
      telepathically relay the information to her agents for later use.
      Following that, she reveals that the tattoo on her right hand is the key
      to the vault. She allows the characters to study it so they can replicate
      its image using magic such as
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Disguise Self.png"
        >disguise self</a
      >
      or
      <a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Spells/Minor Illusion.png"
        >minor illusion</a
      >, or even copy it with pen and ink. In any case, a character must succeed
      on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to correctly re-create the tattoo,
      which requires 10 minutes of study or drawing. The characters can retry if
      they fail, at the cost of more time and more risk of discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Last Resort.</em></strong> A gruesome but effective option is
      killing <strong>Prisoner 13</strong> and taking her body back, or just her
      right hand. If the characters are working for the Golden Vault, they know
      the organization would not approve of this method. The characters receive
      no reward from the organization if they kill or mutilate
      <strong>Prisoner 13</strong>.

    <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Before you Varrin's joy and relief crack his usually reserved exterior,
        and he generally appears over the moon. A man of his word, he insists
        there is no time to lose and leads you on your way to the vault. You
        take a journey into the mountains to the north of gullet, deep into
        Fairheight Range. The route is a little perilous, but you expect nothing
        less from someone who has tried to hide an enormous wealth stolen from
        the dwarves.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      You arrive after a few days travel, feeling a little less rested, but
      interested to see if this whole adventure has been worth it. Arriving to
      the newly excavated vault, you notice several other Thieflings around
      clearly on the look out for the dwarves, along with a small collection of
      beasts of burden with carts ready to haul whatever is inside away before
      thw dwarves even get here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you stands an enormous silver and gold circular door, which clearly
      has been cleaned in the hope they would find a lock. With this Varrin
      Looks to yourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party will not need to look too hard to find the pattern from the arm
      of Prisoner 13. Once they interact with it, in virtually anyway, see how
      they choose. The door will open.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The huge vault door begins to make a collection of both mechanical
        unlocking sounds, along with a variety of dispell effects. The door was
        clearly protected by a lot of mechanisms. The vault has been opened.
        While much of the clan’s stolen wealth has been spent, there’s still a
        good fortune remaining. Varrin of course makes good on his bargain,
        offering a more than fair share for your work. He, and the other
        theiflings will take the gold, but there are a collection of magical
        items. Varrin offers each of you the choice of an item to take, the ones
        you dont pick, he will take to the guild as payment for thier services.
