    <p>A Troubling Morning</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You awaken inside you room at the Inn, a few days have passed since your
        visit to what could playfully be called a pet shop. But in actuality was
        a new form of slave trafficking
      </li>
      <li>
        You have successfully brought down this ‘Pet shop’ but you are under no
        illusion it’s the only one, and there would certainly appear to be a
        market for it.
      </li>
      <li>
        The day begins like any other with breakfast in the inn. Today’s menu:
        <ul>
          <li>Bread and water (5CP)</li>
          <li>Eleven Bread &amp; Cheese (5SP)</li>
          <li>Poached prawns in a herb butter (1GP)</li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Outside you start to hear the gathering of people, and the various
        patrons begin leaving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Groups of people line the edge of the streets creating a walk way
        through the centre.
      </li>
      <li>Bells can also be heard ringing from the nearby temple.</li>
      <li>
        The March
        <ul>
          <li>
            2 Members of the golden collar walk in front, in a golden ornate
            armour, and Two at the back.
            <ul>
              <li>
                2 Large breed dogs walk ahead, each in ornate golden uniforms
                walks along, a small golden crown perched across their heads and
                a large golden collar. They shine and glint in the sun, having
                clearly been polished for many hours.
              </li>
              <li>
                2 Large cats walk behind, in a similar attire, they too look
                impeccable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each of them carries with them a large ornate spear, the head of
                which looks like it would wreck you on the way in, let alone the
                devastation it would cause on the way out.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            2 people seeking atonement
            <ul>
              <li>
                A naked Dog &amp; Cat, both appear dirt covered, and a little
                malnourished.
              </li>
              <li>
                The dog has got marks across her back from clearly some form of
                whipping. You imagine this was caused by a lash or two, part of
                the atonement.
              </li>
              <li>
                The cat appears to be walking blindfolded. As such there are a
                variety of scrapes and marks over his body where he has
                obviously tumbled and stumbled.
              </li>
              <li>
                Both of them wear a crown of thorns, which has also pierced the
                skin, and small trickles of blood fall from their face.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            3 priests of the good mother
            <ul>
              <li>
                All three priests walk, head bowed with the same grey robes, and
                dark hood covering their head and face. It would appear that 2
                of them are awoken dogs, and one an awoken cat. But given the
                fact that all their features are hidden, you would be forgiven
                for thinking it’s possible one of the dogs is actually a young
                Tiefling.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The High Priest
            <ul>
              <li>
                The High priest is well-spoken, but does not believe in wasting
                time. Since his ascension from priest to high priest, his nice
                well-mannered demeanour has changed to a more focused and rule
                enforcing tone. As the highest-ranking member of the ‘Good
                Mother’ he has really let a certain amount of power go to his
                head.
              </li>
              <li>
                His robes are perfectly pressed and spotlessly clean, unlike the
                rest of the priests, it would seem his robes are cleaned by
                others to an impeccable standard, as opposed to by themselves,
                and as quick as possible as its your only item of clothing. He
                also does not wear a hood, his face completely on show, which is
                also unusual.
              </li>
              <li>
                He is an elf, and the first non-awoken animal to have made it to
                such a high station in the history of the Temple. But given that
                all high priests are selected by a series of votes and ballots
                by its members, he has clearly done something right.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The crowd geer and boo at the sinners. Some even throw things,
            including faecal matter. This usually results in a member of the
            Golden Collar beating them back with the shaft of the spear. This
            both assert some dominance, as well as prevents a riot breaking out.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="a-familiar-bloody-face">A Familiar, Bloody face.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Amid all the chatter from the crowd cries of help can be heard.</li>
      <li>
        A dwarf breaks through the line and falls to his knees in front of the
        procession. He casts his helmet aside to reveal the Cunning Man,
        kneeling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before much can be said by anyone he calls out<br />

        <em
          >“Priests of the good mother, I have sinned and require atonement. I
          have killed and murders, raped and pillaged, I have traded tainted
          drugs, and I have traded souls into slavery. I have sinned and seek
          atonement”.</em
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        He can quite clearly be seen with a sizable bite across his shoulder and
        chest. The odds are that it will not kill him, it certainly would be
        causing him significant amounts of pain, and might help explain some of
        his look of sheer panic.
      </li>
      <li>
        The sinner will be encouraged to join the line under the protection of
        the Good Mother, as such he cannot be touched by the watch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any attempt to attack or interfere will result in the Golden Collar
        inflicting a certain degree of violence.

    <p>The Temple Of Virtuous Probability</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The house of discussion will include all priests and everyone will look
        nervous. The voice will start with a bit of a shaky opening.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Brothers, sisters we are here to discuss the grand library and the
            ring of Arcanis. We have need for volunteers to go down and collect
            some books and attune some of the orbs of the elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            The response from the priests will be that people go missing down
            there and something is evil is down there causing issues.
          </li>
          <li>The high priest will nod slowly.</li>
          <li>
            The voice will continue, well than something must be done to inspect
            whatever evil lay in wait down there. What say you brothers and
            sisters, any volunteers?
          </li>
          <li>No one will rise to bait.</li>
          <li>
            Fine, we must seek help from the outside. I doubt the golden collar
            will help.
          </li>
          <li>
            What shall the reward be, aside from a religious blessing, and good
            favour from the temple.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        A reward will come in time, depending on how the rest of things plays
        out.

    <h2 id="the-grand-library">The Grand Library</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The grand library has been trashed, there are books and paper
        everywhere. It would seem looking at it, like a small tornado had been
        through here.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Arcanis Ring will be dripping with old dry blood. It is actually
        hard to tell that there was even remains of someone there. The only clue
        you have is the robes, which have acted as a sponge soaking up some of
        the blood.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are many books, most of them talk of the history and stories of
        the good mother, as well as lore of the world. There is even a copy of
        ‘Tales From the North, East And South there’. Although they talk more of
        the life of Alaundo, and not much else.
      </li>
      <li>
        James will find a scroll. Alone on a shelf, the rest of the paper
        appears to have been removed from the shelf and shredded, but this
        single scroll remains perfectly in place.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="a-fight-breaks-out">A Fight Breaks Out</h3>

    <p>
      <em>
        Thank you for releasing me, I have been watching, and waiting for over

      <ul>
        <li>You feel something trying to break into your mind.</li>
        <li>
          You feel a low hum rising up in your mind, getting louder and louder,
          it transcends from a hum to more of a deep roar. As it reaches its
          crescendo, the sound is so loud, it causes you ro shut your eyes,
          cover your ears and wince in pain. Just when you think your very mind
          itself is on the brink of collapse, you hear a single word,
          ‘Potential’. The sound immediately dissipates and you feel your mind
          return to normal.
        </li>
        <li>
          The voice, is strangely familiar to you, like something out of a

    <h4>Saint Bernard</h4>
    <em>
      <ul>
        <li>
          After turning away from your deity, in the quest to found your own
          religion and with it, your own path to religious enlightenment, your
          prayers to the gods have gone unanswered.
        </li>
        <li>
          You remember from your early days of training, it always felt like the
          gods were with you, almost as if inside of your very soul. The feeling
          of a warm glow inside and of never being truly alone. But from the
          moment you turned away to forge your own path, that feeling
          disappeared and it felt as if the gods had abandoned you to your fate.
        </li>
        <li>Until now.</li>
        <li>
          It has certainly been many moons since you felt like this. That
          feeling of a higher power becoming one with you, that feeling of your
          very soul no longer being alone. Having followed many deities along
          your path, you are aware each one feels different. With each deity
          comes new thoughts and ideas, with each pulling your moral compass in
          a different direction.
        </li>
        <li>
          This one however is something entirely new. Your moral compass feels
          somewhat unchanged. But it feels as if this is less to do with your
          moral compass lining up, and more because this new presence has no
          moral compass at all. In fact there is a single feeling that
          overwhelms your senses. The feeling of pure, uncut, power.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inside your mind, you feel a deep, dark voice, coming from your new
          companion, It utters a single phrase.

      </li>
      <li>
        The shreds of the old scrolls remaining, would appear to have been
        slowly tearing themselves over several days. Its unclear how they have
        been doing it, but it is safe to assume that Allip is probably somehow
        involved.
      </li>
      <li>
        The cube is the cause for the murder of the two monks, and there is a

        The books on the shelves are not only a history of the various
        religions, there is also talk of the various histories from the region.
        It would also seem there is a book relating and belonging to every

      <li>
        Not one to be left out, you feel a calling in your mind. A low hum
        coming from this corner of the library [somewhere no one is].
      </li>
      <li>
        You walk over to find a rapier sitting on a stand, behind a pane of
        glass. The glass appears to be nothing special at first glance.
      </li>
      <li>
        The sword itself is ornate and golden. The hilt itself bright gold and
        elegant, catches any light in the room, and shines like the morning sun.
        The grip wound to pure perfection with a white stained leather. The
        blade itself is a metallic silver, with a ornate 2 stage fuller with a
        gold inlay. You imagine detail like this would have taken even a master
        blacksmith days or even weeks to perfect to this level. On the blade
        there are 3 words engraved, but you dont recognise the language. [The
        Darkness Binds] → Sylvan (SILL-vun)
      </li>
      <li>Break the glass, take the weapon and walk out to show everyone.</li>
    </ul>

    <em>
      You grip the hilt and give the weapon a few light swings, it feels light,
      elegant, like a writer to their quill, or a musician to their instrument,
      it feels like an extension of yourself.
      <p>
        Initially everything feels great, until inside your head you feel a
        pounding. Like the worst migraine you have ever felt. Your arm suddenly
        begins aching, your paw burns and you try to let go. But the more you
        try to tell your paw to drop the blade, the tighter it grips it. You
        call out in pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of you notice that the tip of the blade begins to change
        colour, the once chrome silver begins to fall away into dust, leaving
        behind a blade of metallic black. Like a corruption, it slowly spreads
        up the blade towards Kerwyns paw. As it hits the engraving in the fuller
        each letter glows bright white.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cedar, you recognise the language as Sylvan (SILL-vun) and the three
        words translate to ‘The Darkness Binds’
      </p>
      <p>
        The corruption continues to spread up the blade and the gold on the
        ornate cross guard falls away leaving behind a chrome silver.
      </p>
      <p>
        The burning intensifies as the corruption hits your arm, as if someone
        was slowly dragging you into molten lava. The corruption spreads fast,
        as it hits your chest. Your clothes and fur changing colour as it
        spreads. Your once green clothes changes to black, with red highlights
        and your fur changes black along with it. As the corruption spreads up
        your head and neck to your eyes they too change colour. Your once warm
        brown eyes have now been replaced with a harrowing red glow that shines
        bright-light in the dimly lit room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your headache intensifies as it feels like hundreds of doors are being
        suddenly closed, and sealed shut, but at the same time thousands of
        others are now opening. Your mind now free to explore its untapped
        potential. Outside you hear a loud crash of thunder from directly
        overhead and almost within an instant the headache stops. You feel like
        a brand new you. Reawakened, driven, focused. Whilst you still feel like
        yourself, you feel like each of your traits have been stretched to their
        absolute extremes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You raise your empty paw in front of you, and a glowing green orb of
        crackling energy appears floating a few inches above your hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of you notice a subtle smile grace Kerwyns face, and with a
        single fluid movement the orb is thrown full blast at a nearby book
        case. Paper, wood and splinters erupt from the shelves.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Kerwyn you know would have immediately run over to it, apologising
        and attempting to fix the damage in any way possible. This Kerwyn simply
        breaks out into hysterical laughter.

      You return to the temple and come face to face with ‘The Voice’. Pleased
      to see you, you tell him of your success in ridding the Library of the
      evil within. Whilst he does ask you the source of the evil, he is simply
      pleased you have completed the task. Escorting you to the greenhouse he
      summons several priests to collect your reward.
      <p>
        A short time passes and several priests arrive, the first with a rather
        small chest. Inside is a small amount of catnip. But this is not any
        nip, this is the temples private stash, dating back hundreds of years.
        You are aware, like most, that catnip loses its potency with age, but
        this is unlike anything you have seen before. The nip appears to have
        been blended with a collection of additional herbs which reverse the
        effect entirely. Somehow this blend only improves with age, and the the
        high with it. The smell alone is enough for you to forget all the other
        rewards and focus solely on the catnip.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn’t take more than a few small hits before you find yourself
        falling into a euphoric state, and begin falling in and out of
        consciousness. This is not the first time you have had a bit too much of
        the nip. But this is certainly the first time you have experienced this
        euphoric state after so little. You have visited many wondrous places
        during your trips in the past, but this feels different.

        Before you stands a tall woman, her eyes glow bright. She wears a blue
        robe and is armour clad in the most amazing golden jewelled armour. She
        holds in her hand a tall white staff with a blue jewel at the top. You
        notice two giant wings spread from her back stretching wide. But these
        are not normal wings. The wings themselves appear to be made up of the
        very forest itself. Where there would be bone, appears to be made up of
        tree limbs and where there would be feathers, giant leaves flutter in
        the wind.
      </p>
      <p>
        She is first to speak, breaking the silence, her voice soft, and her
        words old.

        She lowers her giant staff, and aims in in your direction. You see her
        utter a few words and a beam of vivid green light shoots from the end of
        the staff striking you in the heart. You awaken suddenly, your mind open
        to a new possibilities. You also feel a strange warm sensation inside,
        it is unusual, but also reassuring as if Silvanus is with you.

      During the fight, Saint, you got up close and personal with several of the
      creatures that were being fought. Normally that’s fine, although this time
      you ran into a situation with an Acid based cube, and well, its slightly
      less fine.
      <p>
        Having just witnessed Kerwyns transformation you feel a small ache in
        your back and you reach to stretch. As you put both paws in the air as
        high as you can in the hope to crack your back, you feel a sudden rush
        of air. As if a large item of clothing were to have suddenly come off.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of you notice that in the exact spot where Saint was previously
        standing, now stands a goblin. On the floor in front of him is a (now
        you see it closer) really poor attempt at a chihuahua disguise. You
        notice that its not even the right size, in fact its not even close. To
        fit a goblin of this size inside, the Chihuahua would have actually been
        around 10 times the normal size.
      </p>
      <p>
        Realising what has happened the goblin cracks a rather awkward smiles,
        and gives a little wave to you all.

      Lastly Talin. For the last few days you have been experiencing a strange
      feeling. You have been hearing voices in your mind, and your connection to
      the Welcoming Dark has been bleeding through to the waking plane. But now
      things are getting stranger. As you walked over to the Arcanis ring in the
      grand library you felt the voice in your mind once again. It called
      potential. But it seems somewhat displeased with you. You feel your mind
      being pulled and tugged. This time its not pulling on your moral compass,
      or pulling on an idea. It feels like its actually pulling you. Your very
      soul in fact feels like its being ripped from your body.
      <p>
        Your eyes shut as you wince in pain. You start to black out and as you
        begin falling backwards, you brace for the impact of the floor. But it
        never comes.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the rest of you, you notice that where Talin once stood, now stands
        an Eladrin in what can only be described as ‘spring attire’. Where Talin
        has gone you are unsure, but it would seem you have a new companion
        joining you on your adventures. There is one thing that comes to mind
        however. Given that the priests know Talin as your ‘Leader’ claiming the
        reward might be a touch more difficult.

    <ul>
      <li>
        As you ascend the stairs screams of pain can be heard coming from the
        cells.
      </li>
      <li>
        Visiting the room will find several priests sat round the table and the
        cunning man strapped to the chair. He has had his shirt torn off, the
        shreds of fabric lay on the floor. Looking at him will reveal his body
        is heavily scared, but that isnt the main focus. The bite across his
        shoulder is not only huge, it is deep and shows signs of the fact is has
        been bleeding a lot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Medicine check: will reveal that not only is the bite big, it appears to
        be festering with some form of infection, as if it had been like this
        for weeks. Although you recall only seeing him a few days ago, and he
        looked absolutely fine then.
      </li>
      <li>
        The high priest will be pouring a curious liquid over his cuts which
        will be making the cuts smoke and burn. Clearly causing unbearable pain.

        Before he can finish the high priest throws whats left of the potion
        bottle over the wound, Previously it had been drips and drops, this time
        it was almost half a pint of liquid. The screams echo as the cunning man
        loses consciousness.
      </p>

    <p>
      If questioned regarding what information has been gleaned, the high priest
      will share the following knowledge:
    </p>
    <p>
      the general notes are that he is not in charge, something about a bite
      from something. As well as asking us to chain him up for some reason. Not
      sure what or why?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        He has been fairly forthcoming with information, the main issue is,
        whilst he is keen to share what he knows, he doesnt seem to know much.
      </li>
      <li>
        He claims he is not the one in charge, he works for someone, but he
        claims he doesnt know their name, or even what they looks like, he has
        been blindfolded every time he has been taken there. The only useful
        information this has had told us is the smell. He claims of a smell of
        rot and death. He sadly cant even tell us a voice, he claims that the
        voice appears in his mind and changes constantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        During a line of questioning he got rather irate and kept going on about
        ‘powerful allies’, and in one extreme case threatened to set some ‘Shark
        Man’ on myself and the temple. We had given him a special blend of
        veritaserum the Astronomer has created. However it is different every
        time, and this particular batch is rather peculiar and has a tendency to
        cause vivid and sometimes violent hallucinations, so we just attributed
        it to that.
      </li>
      <li>
        The last and most curious is he keeps asking us what the lunar day is.
        ‘Solaris’ has elected to withhold this information in the hope we may
        use it as a bartering tool in another line of questioning. But for the
        moment he is unconscious and judging by previous experience, that will
        probably be him out cold for the next 5-6 hours at least.
