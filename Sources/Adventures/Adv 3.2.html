    <h1 id="">One Snowy Morning...</h1>
    <h2 id="">Midwinter Is Upon Us</h2>
    <p>
      You awaken in the Scratching Post, your usual inn of choice for Gullet
      Cove. Outside a blanket of deep snow covers the city and those few souls
      walking the streets are wrapped up warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scents of mulled cider and gingerbread wafting up from downstairs,
      warm and welcoming, it would appear that many townsfolk have come in to
      escape the cold. There's a dreamlike quality to the atmosphere, and much
      of the inn has been decorated in colour ribbons and small candles behind
      rainbow glass. Once the players gather read:
    </p>
    <em>
      An azure-skinned man with bright white, fabulously coifed hair, and a
      goatee resembling an icicle stands behind the bar. As you gather in the
      main room of the tavern, he watches with a smile. Once you've all gathered
      together, he addresses the everyone in the inn, "Welcome! Welcome and good
      morning! It is so nice of you to join us here. The name's Jack, and I look
      forward to seeing how each of you fare in todays games and festivities. I
      know the city is on a bit of a lockdown, but that’s no reason why we cant
      celebrate Midwinter*. But I digress, would you all care to start your day
      with something to eat? Or perhaps a drink? Have a seat, and let me know
      what I can get you!"
    </em>
    <p>
      (<strong>*Midwinter</strong> also known as <strong>Deadwinter Day</strong>
      was a festival to mark to beginning of winter in Faerûn)
    </p>

    <p>
      Jack appears to be a Water Genasi, with light blue skin and a white
      pompadour hair cut and a white pointed goatee. He is in fact Jack Frost,
      powerful archfey, an the event co-ordinator for these festivities. He will
      answer a few questions happily enough, though he will feign ignorance if
      his magic abilities or any lies are called into question (+17 Deception).
    </p>
    <h2 id="">Care For A Drink?</h2>
    <p>
      Jack has an impressive selection of drinks available, as well as whatever
      food the characters desire. Among the drinks on offer, Jack eagerly
      suggests Jack Daniels Whiskey, Yukon Jack Whisky (no E), Panama Jack or
      Calico Jack Rum, or Cactus Jack Tequila for those who want a harder
      beverage. As for ales, meads, and the like, he recommends Scrumpy Jack
      Cider, Deadeye Jack Porter, Thirsty Jack IPA, Black Jack Stout, Jack
      Rabbit Pale Ale, Jack's Pumpkin Spice Ale (quite popular with the young
      adventurers nowadays), or Honeyjack Mead. His top picks from the wine list
      are Blackjack Pasture, Jumpin Jack, and Black Jack. [ALL OF THESE ARE FREE
      TODAY]
    </p>

    <h2 id="">Food For Thought</h2>
    <p>
      The characters can learn the following during their initial visit and
      discussion with Jack:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Winter Games are in full swing. Listen for the barkers advertising
        their games around the city.
      </li>
      <li>
        You need at least 6 tokens to claim a prize, but there are 9 games out
        there, the more you collect the better the prize. If you collect all 9
        you unlock the ‘Grand Prize’. All the prizes are a secret, but you are
        assured they are worth the effort.
      </li>
      <li>
        As an aside there was a surge of magical power recently, with some
        strange consequences. Jack encourages the characters to ask around about
        town.
      </li>
      <li>
        He is the orchestrator for all the games, and has been planning this
        since LAST midwinter. He will mention that same of the games have
        returned, but a few have not. The tree cutting contest, little sally
        lost an arm to the battle axe bully was swinging, and in the shock she
        dropped her battle axe on tiny tims foot. Now he needs crutches to walk.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the characters succeed an incredibly high perception/insight check,
        they will tell that jack is a little more magical than he seems to let
        on.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <em>
      DM Note → when the players head back to the inn after collecting all their
      various tokens and such, they will be faced with the runaway tree piece
      from below. The rest of the town is (sort of) open, so the market is
      accessible and such.
    </em>

    <h1 id="">The Games</h1>
    <h2 id="">Game 1: Snowball Battle</h2>
    <p>
      After the characters have ﬁnished drinking and chatting with Jack, he will
      encourage them to leave the inn, and head to the first event. Read the
      following:
    </p>
    <em>
      As you step out of the warm interior of the tavern, a bitter wind nips at
      your noses. Shining ice and crystalline snow line the streets of Gullet
      Cove. Dozens of people pass by hurriedly, preparing for the celebration of
      the Midwinter. Some carry large, colorfully wrapped boxes, while others
      carry huge bags of food and drink. From the edge of town, you can hear a
      barker shouting in a gruﬀ voice, "Prove your mettle in a true test of
      skill! Try your aim in a snowball battle royale!"
    </em>
    <p>
      The ﬁrst event of the celebration is an all-out free-for-all snowball
      battle. Weapons are prohibited on the ﬁeld of battle, which also functions
      as an antimagic ﬁeld. There's plenty of cover on the ﬁeld (see Map 1:
      Snowball Battleﬁeld), so remind your players to think tactically.
    </p>
    <p>
      A male half-orc barker informs the characters of the rules of the battle,
      and facilitates the event.
    </p>
    <em>
      Moguns is a half-orc bard. He is the barker and referee in charge of the
      snowball fights. He's a simple man, but friendly and warm despite his
      gruff voice.
    </em>
    <em>
      Ginry (pronounced like "gin rye") is a Kenku Life Domain cleric with a
      level of druid for access to the goodberry spell. He makes his rounds
      between the snowball arena and the Field of Gifts, healing anyone who
      needs assistance. He frequently spouts non sequiturs vaguely related to
      the healing arts (e.g. "It's just a flesh wound!", "I'm not gonna make it,
      Sarge!", or "We need a medic!"). If the characters left the tavern without
      obtaining any knowledge from Jack himself, Ginry can also serve to provide
      some level of exposition to the characters by repeating things he has
      heard Jack tell other adventurers about the festivities.
    </em>
    <h3>The Rules of Engagement</h3>
    <p>
      Snowballs can be thrown as an attack action, they are improvised ranged
      weapons (10/30ft) (1D20 + Dex - No Proficiency). You each start with 2,
      and it takes either a movement or attack action to make one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each player has 3 lives, if you are hit, you lose a life. When you run out
      you are out. The last character standing wins the battle and gets a prize.
    </p>
    <p>(Add 1 townsfolk to the mix - but let the players win)</p>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="">Game 2: The Game Of Gifts</h2>
    <p>After the snowball battle, read the following:</p>
    <em>
      An elderly tiefling woman hands out piping-hot mugs of cocoa to the winner
      and losers alike. The taste is divine, and as you drink it you can feel
      the icy chill melt away. As you sip your hot cocoa while gearing back up
      and recovering from the grueling snowball battle, you hear a barker
      shouting out from another field, "Try your luck! Will it bite or will it
      bless? Who knows! Play the Game of Gifts and find out!"
    </em>
    <p>
      The cocoa staves oﬀ the exhaustion from extreme cold for 1d4 hours. Next
      up is a high-stakes guessing game. A male gnome with wild hair and a glint
      in his eye runs it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gimble presents to the characters another large ﬁeld, on which there lies
      many large, colorfully wrapped gift boxes. Each character may purchase a
      turn to pick a present from the ﬁeld of gifts for 10 gp with each extra
      turn costing more unless the characters take Gimble up on a gamble. Twenty
      gifts dot the ﬁeld, but be warned, for ﬁve of them are actually
      <strong>gift mimics</strong> in disguise!
    </p>
    <em>
      Gimble Gemble the Gambler is the facilitator for the Game of Gifts. He is
      a charismatic warlock with an Archfey patron (Can you guess who?). If a
      character runs from a mimic, Gimble will use his eldritch blasts to send
      it to its holding cell. Being the gambler that he is, he will occasionally
      oﬀer extra picks to a character if they can successfully pick out a gift
      mimic on purpose.
    </em>
    <p>
      If using physical maps, set up the field with the included tokens to flip
      over for each result. If you are using Theatre of the Mind, have each
      player roll a d20 to randomly pick a present (ignore and reroll repeats).

    <h2 id="">Trees Do What Now?</h2>
    <p>
      After the characters return to the inn to claim their reward read the
      following:
    </p>
    <em>
      As you set back out into the town, you overhear a woman in a heated
      conversation with a member of the Golden Collar. "Right, it just walked
      out of your house then? You been drinkin' a bit too much egg nog again,
      Ruthie? Trees ain't got legs, an' they don't move on their own. You pro'ly
      ne'er even 'ad a tree to begin with." With that, the constable walks off
      shaking his head. The woman flips him off, then turns around to face the
      party. "Oh, well, uh, you didn't see nothin' there, right? But have you
      seen my Solstice tree? It... sort of... wandered off."
    </em>
    <p>
      Ruth goes on to explain how her fully decorated Solstice tree just picked
      up its roots and knocked down her door. She informs the party that several
      other households have experienced the same phenomenon, but the guards
      aren't taking any of them seriously. She offers the party a nice
      old-fashioned home-cooked meal if they agree to figure out what's going on
      and return the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidence left behind by the tree's departure is as expected, an
      assortment of decorations that quite clearly fell off during the egress,
      as well as a few smaller branches and a boat load of pine needles. They
      can find some clues in her home after eating a nice old-fashioned
      homecooked meal. A detect magic spell will register a lingering aura of
      transmutation around the planter the tree was housed in prior to its
      egress.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check,
      they find evidence that Ruth was telling the truth—marks in the splintered
      door appear to have been made by the ornamented branch of a pine tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a character succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check, they can pick
      up the trail and follow it out into the woods. Once in the woods, another
      Wisdom (Survival) check (DC 15 this time) is necessary to follow the path
      of the tree into the woods.
    </p>

    <h2 id="">The Talk Of The Town</h2>
    <p>
      As the characters leave ruths house they will soon discover that nearly
      all of the decorated Solstice trees have gone missing, though not all as
      violently as Ruth's.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mabel's tree came to life while they were decorating it and nearly gave
        her husband a heart attack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ethel's tree absconded in the middle of the night and left nothing but a
        few pine needles leading to the chimney.
      </li>
      <li>
        Petunia's tree leaped out of a second story window into a passing wagon,
        and she swears it performed a rude gesture with its branches somehow.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whiskers even claims that their tree actually started a fight with them
        before making a break for the door. During their escape whiskers tackled
        the tree into the lit fire place. Which through a series of unfortunate
        events caused their entire house to burn down.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="">On The Trail</h1>
    <h2 id="">To The Graveyard...</h2>
    <p>
      All the various routes lead across town to the graveyard which is a large
      area lined with a variety of trees. You follow a trail of tinsel,
      decorations and pine needles through the snow across the town and you will
      find an area of the graveyard occupied by several fully decorated pine
      trees. If any character approaches within 5 feet of the trees, they
      animate immediately and reveal themselves to actually be 4 Awakened
      Solstice Trees. Unless the characters have explicitly stated that they
      expect the trees to be animate before this point, the characters are
      surprised for the first round of combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      From within the branches of the nearest tree, you hear a voice call out,
      &quot;Death to the fleshy ones! Spill their blood to water our
      roots!&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The awakened Solstice trees make the most of their Dazzling Ornamentation
      trait and gang up on any character affected by it. It's not the end of the
      adventure if the party is defeated at this point, so feel free to really
      go all out against your players and work out any aggression you have
      towards any of them. One defeated all the will remain is splinters of
      wood, some ruined decorations and a lot of pine needles, you think you
      will be finding them for weeks.
    </p>

    <h2 id="">The Blighted Caves</h2>
    <p>
      The party can follow the trail of tinsel (Survival DC 12) back to a
      collection of rather old gravestones. One of the graves is a small
      building with a stone door which has been smashed open. Inside a stairwell
      can be found which seems to lead down to a cave system deep underground.
      When the characters reach the caves, read the following:
    </p>
    <em>
      After about an hour of trailing after tinsel, you arrive at an opening in
      the face of a mountain deep in the woods. More tinsel, along with various
      ornamentation, hangs haphazardly across it. Broken wooden toys lay
      scattered about. A group of three colorful coniferous humanoids is
      currently patrolling the area around the cave entrance. It seems likely
      this cave leads to the source of this whole kerfuffle. The characters will
      now have to fight the 10 Festive Needle Blights if they wish to proceed
      into the cave. If they are quiet enough, they might be able to take out
      the first group of 3 at the mouth of the tunnels without immediately
      alerting the 7 others further in. After the party defeats the initial ten
      blights, read the following:
    </em>
    <em>
      As the rush of combat fades from your senses and you venture forth into
      the cave, you hear what sounds like the rustling of leaves and shuffling
      of branches coming from further within the cave system. To your right, a
      short tunnel leads to a rickety looking bone-crafted cage that is
      currently empty, though it looks to have seen its fair share of prisoners.
      Ahead of you lies darkness, as well as whatever is behind these
      disturbances.
    </em>

    <h2 id="">We Need To Go Deeper</h2>
    <p>
      As the characters progress further into the caves, the light fades
      entirely until it is pitch black. The party will find the remaining Needle
      Blights each can be encountered or avoided on the way to the main chamber
      of the cave system (their locations are marked on Map 5). The cave is cold
      and damp, and has a smell of really old pine, almost going bad/rotting
      level pine. When the characters finally reach the central chamber, read
      the following:
    </p>
    <em>
      As you descend yet another ramp and round yet another bend in the tunnel,
      the warm glow of a fire can be seen coming from a chamber ahead. As you
      approach, you see the tunnel opens up into a large circular chamber. A
      large bonfire burns in the center of the chamber, while a menagerie of
      animated trees and blights seemingly dance around the flickering flames,
      emitting a strange sound that almost sounds like language, but there's
      something not quite right about it. You briefly wonder about the ethical
      ramifications of animated trees burning what are essentially the corpses
      of its fallen brethren. Wow, these trees are messed up.
    </em>
    <p>
      Dancing around the bonfire are several awakened trees and a few needle
      blights. They appear to be chanting and are in general unaware of the
      whole situation with the players and could be surprised.
    </p>

    <h2 id="">The Final Showdown</h2>
    <p>
      After the characters defeat this last group of plants, read the following:
    </p>
    <em>
      From a hidden alcove, a voice cries out, "What have you done!? You've
      killed them! You've killed them all! I was saving them from a slow death
      trapped inside away from nature, and you killed them anyway! You worthless
      sacks of excrement and meat! You will pay for your folly!"
      <p>
        At that moment, the fire in the center of the room flares brightly,
        spreading out in an instant to consume the corpses of the plant
        creatures in a flash. Suddenly the cavern fills with a crackling
        laugh... and the delicious fragrant aroma of roasting chestnuts.
      </p>
      <p>
        An elf draped in rotting leathers studded with gnarly chunks of bones
        and teeth emerges from the shadows. He wields a long staff that appears
        to have been carved from the femur of a large humanoid, and a dull black
        shield that seems to absorb the light around him. He is flanked by one
        of the colorful blights. His eyes glow with an intense hatred as he
        levels his gaze at the party, &quot;Oh yes... You. Will. Pay.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, from what was seemingly a once normal bonfire walks a fire
        elemental, as the elf upon his raised shelf starts laughing manically.
      </p>
    </em>
    <p>
      Eluyeta Hyllaerrion begins hostile towards the characters, and will attack
      them on his turn during initiative, as will the
      Chestnuts-Roasting-On-An-Open- Fire Elemental.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible for the characters to attempt to pledge that they are
      sympathetic to Eluyeta's cause by spending an action on their turn to
      attempt a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check if they are genuine or a DC 20
      Charisma (Deception) check if they are just trying to buy time. If they
      succeed, Eluyeta will stay his hand, for the time being, so that matters
      can be discussed further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eluyeta's demands are rather extreme, however, and the characters are
      unlikely to come to an agreement with him. His demands are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The people of the town must agree to never cut down and decorate the
        corpse of another tree, under punishment of death.
      </li>
      <li>
        For each tree that was cut down, he demands one humanoid limb from the
        townsfolk.
      </li>
      <li>
        One young adult humanoid must be presented on a yearly basis to
        Eluyeta's cave for him to affix to a post, decorate with barbed tinsel
        and hooked ornaments, and be provided with nothing but water until
        death.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If the characters actually agree to Eluyeta's demands, they'll get lynched
      when they get back to town; and honestly, we will need to stop to to talk
      about what this means for the rest of the campaign.
    </p>

    <h2 id="">After the Battle</h2>
    <p>
      If Eluyeta and his Chestnuts-Roasting-On-An-Open-Fire Elemental are
      defeated, the characters can recover his belongings, among which is a
      journal filled with pages upon pages about the plight of the Solstice
      trees.

    <h1 id="">The Heroes Return</h1>
    <h2 id="">The Prize Giving Ceremony</h2>
    <p>
      Upon the defeat of Eluyeta, they will be free to loot the cave where they
      will find a variety of solstice decorations littering the cave. They are
      free to progress on as they see fit, but overall there will be nothing
      further of note in the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon making their way back to town they will find a variety of the
      townsfolk will be waiting around for an update from the adventurers. There
      is no benefit or drawback for this, it would just be interesting to see
      what they come up with as things go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon returning to the inn, you find a big crowd of people all waiting for
      the prize giving ceremony, also possibly for the free Jack-Related
      beverages, you’re unsure, but never the less, the place is packed. As you
      walk in Jack offers a round of applause to the team with the most tokens,
      yourselves. He beacons you up onto the stage to claim your prize, but not
      before acknowledging the extra work you have done with helping solve the
      mystery of the missing trees.
    </p>
    <p>As you all line up upon the stage jack begins his speech.</p>
    <em>
      My Dear Friends, welcome to the scratching post for this the celebration
      of Midwinter. As you all know we have a friendly competition each year
      with prizes up for grabs! Now I do hope you all enjoyed the games, there
      were a few new ones to replace some of the err, well lets just say, some
      of the less successful ones!
      <p>
        Now here we have upon the stage the winners of this years Midwinter
        games, and for the first time ever a team has claimed all 9 winners
        tokens. So my friends I present to you the top prize, something truly
        special and incredibly rare.
      </p>
      <p>
        A small table is placed at the front of the stage with a red silk cloth
        over it. Jack being the showman he is, builds a little tension and
        dramatically removes the cloth and revealing 6 large candle jars with
        lids, each filled with white wax. The label on the outside is old and
        tatty and has clearly seen many winters. The label reads: ‘Illithid
        Candle’
      </p>
      <p>
        Jack is excited and starts to present each of you one by one with a
        candle, addressing the inn as he does so: “As the grand prize winners, I
        gift each of you these incredibly rare Illithid candles.” Jack is paused
        for a moment as a murmuring starts emanating from the crowd gathered in
        the inn, before the sound is broken by a drunkard at the back calling:
        ‘whats an ill-thud?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Jack pauses for a moment: “Ah yes of course, in Faerûn you know
        illithids by a different name, Mind Flayers”. The Crowd gasps a little.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally getting the reaction he wanted, Jack continues: “Legend goes
        that the wax for these 6 candles was collected thousands of years ago
        from deep within the Mind Flayer City from the ruler of the mind
        flayers, the Elder Brain. But whilst interesting, thats not the exciting
        bit about these candles. The true excitement happens when you remove the
        lid“
      </p>
      <p>
        With a single wave of his hand, the lid of each candle falls to the
        floor and the wax is exposed to the air for the first time. A stale and
        musky smell fills your lungs as if these jars haven’t been opened in a
        millennia.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you try to take your next breath, you falter for a moment and you
        feel your mind under siege from something. You blink a few times, as you
        gasp again trying to grab your next breath. Something is in your mind,
        combing through it, searching for something, a memory, or a feeling, its
        hard to say, but it also isnt your primary focus right now. As you
        attempt your third breath, you feel a snap and the combing instantly
        releases, as if it found what its looking for. You take a deep breath
        and your breathing returns to normal again and with it, you each
        exchange looks to confirm you all experienced the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        But during these exchanges you hear gasps from the crowd. You look down
        to see that your candle is changing colour before your very eyes, and
        the smell is changing along with it. Jack Smiles and says: “each candle
        is based upon your personality and is tailored towards each of you.
        Enjoy my friends, and happy Midwinter”.
