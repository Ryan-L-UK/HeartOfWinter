    <em>
      The crisis of war has been adverted, by your respective hands no less, and
      the criminal Le-Furr is heading off to answer his crimes. Well more like
      he is going to lose his head BECAUSE of his crimes, but either way, you
      have not heard anything since, which you can only assumed is someone good
      news, in its own little way. Each of you took some well-deserved time off
      over the past few weeks and decided to pursue some of your own interests.
      Your paths no doubt crossed at points, but you each tended to go your own
      way. You all agreed to meet mid-morning today at The Water Bowl as last
      night it appeared to be the scene of a lot of commotion. On your
      respective walks over, a couple of you heard the townsfolk telling stories
      of what happened.</em
    >
    <h2 id="inside-the-inn">Inside The Inn</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Water Bowl is a well-kept tavern with just enough frills and rough
        edges to make most feel comfortable.
      </li>
      <li>
        The dining room has a bar and several tables, enough to comfortably hold
        up to 30. The morning meal here is a pleasant combination of bread and
        honey mixed with cinnamon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Between the outside light through the open windows or the green
        driftglobe over the bar, the dining room is brightly lit. These may be
        used to reveal title mark glyphs’ nature (see sidebar) such as the one
        on the map given to the adventurers.
      </li>
      <li>A handful of commoners are here eating breakfast.</li>
      <li>
        Duric Green the co-owner of the inn tends the bar.
        <ul>
          <li>
            He welcomes the adventures back, even though they have never been
            here and asks if they have come back to get their document?
          </li>
          <li>
            Last night, cleaning up after a bar brawl, Zel found a strange
            looking page with no names or recognizable marks but possessive of a
            curious glow. The inn had no other overnight customers last night,
            so Duric believes that it belongs to one of the adventurers and will
            hand it to them. Otherwise he doesn’t have the slightest clue as to
            whom it may belong.
          </li>
          <li>
            Duric suggests they see where the page leads, offering them a free
            meal and drinks at the inn if they come back with an entertaining
            story (and a cut of whatever treasure they happen to find, you know,
            “a finder’s fee!” of sorts. He winks knowingly).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The page clearly doesn’t belong to the adventurers, but finding the
        actual owners is impossible, The Water Bowl was simply too busy last
        night. Plus, with all of the rumours about treasure in town, most folks
        would claim the paper in the hope it might lead them to the loot. As far
        as Duric is concerned, the page belongs to the adventurers now.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="the-cypher">The Cypher</h2>
    <em>
      The map is on an interesting and unusual paper. The paper itself possesses
      some form of strange shimmer about it, it’s also unusually thick. It takes
      fairly little intelligence to realise this paper is far from ordinary. But
      the problem is its complete blank, less some strange circles and crescent
      moons around the edge of the page.</em

      When read from the first column, top to bottom, it reads:<strong
        >ARTY PAW WAUKEENS PROMENADE</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The Art Paw is an Art Shop in the market district ‘Waukeens Promenade’,
      and should easily be remembered by anyone who has spent time around the
      market district.
    </p>
    <h1 id="a-crypt-portrait">A Crypt Portrait</h1>
    <h2 id="the-arty-paw">The Arty Paw</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The shop is on the first floor of a small 2 story building. A small,
        standard apartment is upstairs, and is the residence of the shop owner,
        Gath (a secret member of the Ouroboros).
      </li>
      <li>
        The shop itself is a display room, 15 feet wide by 50 feet long, with
        shelves spread throughout.
      </li>
      <li>
        A shop counter is along the back wall, next to a door leading to the
        back.
      </li>
      <li>
        Canvas artwork and painted trinkets are on display throughout.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Most of the art includes a white full moon, and everything inside is
            pure white.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The clue the adventurers seek is the wall mounted crypt portrait behind
        the shop counter. ‘Full Moon Crypt’
        <ul>
          <li>
            The portrait features a statue pointing to a mausoleum crypt
            highlighted by a full moon in the background. In the centre of the
            painting several circles and crescent moons can be seen thanks to
            the pure white light, which match that same pattern of the page they
            have in front of them.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        No windows are present on the first floor. A chandelier candelabra
        provides bright white light.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The rope holding the candelabra can be cut, dealing 1d10 bludgeoning
            damage to a creature standing under it. A successful DC 15 Dexterity
            save halves the damage.
          </li>

        The Location. The crypt looks like many others.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The adventures must either take the painting or study it long enough
            to note small identifying landmarks for locating the actual crypt.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is common knowledge that many of the art work in the gallery were
            painted by local artists. There will also be memories of the
            graveyard from the solstice and that there were several crypts like
            this. Perhaps it’s one of them.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="some-resistance">Some Resistance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        At first, Gath acts as a normal shopkeeper. When the adventurers show
        great interest in the crypt portrait, he views them as threats to his
        master to stop at all costs. He refuses all offers to sell the portrait.
      </li>
      <li>
        The crypt in the portrait belongs to his master, who values his privacy.
        Gath knows it will be a fatal mistake if his master discovers his
        portrait led others to his crypt. Gath knows nothing about the symbols
        on the piece, and is shocked by its resemblance to their page.
      </li>
      <li>
        The City Watch. If loud sounds result from a combat in the gallery,
        passers-by hear the disturbance. Fearing for Gath’s life, they call for
        the City Watch who arrive minutes later.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="the-city-of-the-dead">The City of the Dead</h1>
    <h2 id="location-description">Location Description</h2>
    <p>
      The walled cemetery is a public park by day with the gates opening at dawn
      and closing at dusk. As you approach the graveyard you are greeted with an
      old sign carved into the stone holding the gate which reads ‘The City Of
      The Dead’. The last time you came here, you were on the hunt of some
      runaway Christmas trees and the whole land was covered in a blanket of
      snow. It’s easy to see how that detail was overlooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (History) check recalls
      the City of the Dead is the only place in Gullet Cove where the deceased
      can be buried legally. The cemetery is vast and would take days to
      examine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The City of the Dead is surrounded by a wall of cobbled stone. Inside,
      gravel pathways lead throughout the well-manicured gardens. Elegant
      mausoleums, ornate gravestones and mournful statues adorn the public park.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-painting">The Painting</h2>
    <p>
      The image contains clues to the crypt entrance. The painting features a
      stone statue of a cloaked figure pointing toward a mausoleum in the
      foreground. The statue in the painting is easily found on a north-eastern
      hill in the City of the Dead. From there, the mausoleum can be found by
      following the direction that the hand on the statue points toward.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-mausoleum">The Mausoleum</h2>
    <p>
      The mausoleum depicted in the painting is located west of the statue in
      the Lords’ Respite area of the cemetery and belongs to a wealthy family.
      The area has the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Mausoleum. This 10-foot by 15- foot mausoleum is a marble structure
          erected in the likeness of a stately house. Above its metal doors is a
          stone banner inscribed with the name “Gost.” It is 10-feet wide by
          15-feet long. Inside are four alcoves with grave markers for members
          of the Gost family. Some of the tiles have been broken.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Pointing Statue. The statue of a cloaked figure stands on a 5-foot
          square, 10-foot tall plinth, and points toward the Gost mausoleum
          (which is a ruse; the mausoleum isn’t the entrance to the crypts). A
          successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, reveals the statue is a
          new addition to the cemetery. Any character who closely investigates
          the statue and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check
          locates a catch inside a fold of its robe that opens a secret door at
          its base. Otherwise, it takes an hour for them to find the way in
          without making checks.

          NPC’s: Commoner (Blitz - Medium Sized Mongrel) warns the adventures to
          be careful there have been a lot of grave robbers around of late, and

    <h1 id="the-great-sigil">The Great Sigil</h1>
    <h2 id="location-description">Location Description</h2>
    <p>
      The first chamber of the Chapel of Summoning is an enormous rectangular
      room with a carved mural on the floor depicting the Ouroboros. The great
      twin-headed serpentine wyverns meet face to face at the far end of the
      hall, their teeth wrapped around the other’s neck. Their twisting bodies,
      complete with two feet and two wings each cascade down the relief in
      mesmerizing fluid shapes ending at their tails which are conjoined at the
      bottom. The bound tails form a bond that cannot be broken, and from which
      there can be discerned no beginning or end. Six braziers (three to a side)
      light up the mural. The walls are lined with pillars, each of which has a
      word and number etched into it. The far door is firmly locked shut.
    </p>
    <h2 id="unlocking-the-door">Unlocking The Door</h2>
    <p>
      The pillars on the left side are numbered with odd numbers from 1 to 13
      (top is 1, bottom is 13). The right side are numbered with even numbers
      from 2 to 14 (top is 2, bottom is 14). The words etched are as follows:
    </p>
    <em
      >The words etched are as follows:

      </ul>
    </em>
    <h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      The first and last words are “Prime Numbers”, and are a hint to form a
      phrase using only the prime numbered words (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13). The
      sentence forms “Light Must Be Conquered By Dark”, which is a clue to snuff
      out the braziers.

    <p>
      You may choose to roll Intelligence Checks if your adventurers cannot come
      to the solution. Roll with advantage if your player characters have
      relevant mathematical, numeromancy, or cryptographic skills, or are
      proficient in Navigator’s Tools, for example.
    </p>
    <em>
      You douse each of the braziers, and the mural in front of you begins to
      illuminate. Starting from the heads an ethereal blue glow snakes its way
      to the towards the entwined tails of the dragon carvings in front of you.
      Your eyes are drawn to a dark spot where both tails cross.</em
    >
    <p>
      The tiles here are lose, and any form of tampering reveals a lever which
      can be used to open the far door. However, if the room is not totally dark
      when the door is opened, the room’s guardian,<strong>An’kheria</strong>,
      will reveal itself and attack the party. This battle will also occur if
      the party relights the braziers once the far door is open. The doors will
      swing shut immediately and battle will commence.
    </p>
    <h1 id="ankheria">An’kheria</h1>
    <p>
      A great trap door will open from above, and into the room will drop what
      appears to be a hideously deformed drake. Its scales are blackened with
      fire and its body scarred from being used as a guardian by the cult for
      centuries. It is missing one eye and detests the light, particularly fire
      light. This is the light that had been used to scar it during its brutal
      training as a wyrmling. Now all its beastly heart is sworn to is revenge
      on any who bring the fire. Once a white dragon, its wings were clipped and
      cauterized, but it still has teeth, fangs and its ice breath, all the
      better to snuff out even the most resilient blaze.

      is massive and ever in a blind rage. He takes up nearly half the floor
      space of the Great Sigil and will make his first priority to cast the room
      into darkness by targeting the blaze. Should anybody be foolish enough to
      attack him with fire, they will be relentlessly targeted by the dragon
      until they are subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the fires are out, the dragon will be calmer and more methodical in
      his attacks, seeking out the greatest threat first. If the players can
      blind his other eye, he still can detect creatures within 10 feet of him
      with blindsight. This dragon will not yield, and unfortunately, the only
      hope for the creature is to bring an end to its misery.

    <p>When the battle is over, your heroes may proceed.</p>
    <h1 id="the-summoning-circle">The Summoning Circle</h1>
    <h2 id="location-description">Location Description</h2>
    <p>
      The latter chamber of the chapel is a hallway just as long as the great
      sigil. Six pillars line the walls closest to the door, with four braziers
      lighting the way to the centre of the room. A massive summoning circle,
      threatening to call forth a beast of titanic scale, glows ominously,
      bathing the chamber in unholy cerulean light. On closer inspection, the
      circle is actually made up of six smaller circles with a void in the
      centre where they connect. Each circle is manned by a hooded summoner on
      the far end. As you enter you see six summoners are visiable, but two
      appear to glow green, as if having their very energy drained from them.
      The other four continue to chant as the first two collapse into dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the far end of the hall is an altar with an unfortunate victim awaiting
      sacrifice. The young man has blond hair and wears a ceremonial gown
      embroided with the logo of the Ouroboros, a strange cult who worship the
      twoheaded dragon. Considering he is unbound; the only conclusion could be
      that he is a willing sacrifice to call forth his master. The great priest
      behind the altar wears a horned helmet and stands with his hands poised
      over the sacrafice, holding a ceremonial dagger. He noticed you enter and
      places the dagger down on the table and picks up a monstrous battle axe.
    </p>
    <em>
      Interlopers. You dare to profane this sacred ground with your unhallowed
      flesh! I shall strike you down and your blood will slake the thirst of the
      mighty Ouroboros!”</em

      Ralof Serpentsworn alone. If the party consists of four or more players,
      you can add one or two Ouroboros Knights to the battle. As the battle
      presses on, one of the summoners will collapse from their lifeforce being
      drained. The first summoner shall fall on the conclusion of the third
      round, and one summoner will fall each round until all six have been
      drained.
    </p>
    <p>
      If all six summoners are drained, the sacrifice is bathed in a vile
      cerulean light, before being consumed entirely and bringing forth the
      Ouroboros Emissary. If the party can defeat Ralof before the battle is
      over, the Summoning Ritual will fail. Even if the summoners are attacked
      by the party, their work will still continue from the afterlife. Any
      attempt to aid or remove the sacrificial Knight from the slab will have
      him engulfed in light early, and bring forth the Ouroboros emissary
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter what the party does to try and tamper with proceedings, the only
      way to stop the summoning is to kill Ralof (or subdue him) before the
      summoning is complete.

      Ralof Serpentsworn will fall dead, his life force having been consumed in
      the summoning of the great beast. The creature is not the true Ouroboros,
      but a lesser creature that serves him, taking the same shape of a
      twin-headed dragon. While no dragon god, it is nonetheless a powerful foe
      that must be destroyed lest it continues the work and calls forth the true
      beast himself. Its twin heads will attack the party, each snapping after
      its own target. It is capable of utilizing a lightning breath attack from
      its blue head (on the left) and a flame breath attack from its red head
      (on the right).

    <p>
      Upon the defeat of either Ralof or the Ouroboros Emissary, the temple will
      begin to collapse under the strain from the summoning effort. A great
      tremor will quake the entire structure and the party shall have to run to
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note</strong>: While escape should be fairly straightforward, you
      can spice this section up with some skill challenges if you are so
      inclined.

      When the party is outside back in the City Of The Dead, they will find a
      portion of the graveyard will have collapsed and the chapel will be
      buried. The tremors will have been felt across this part of gullet cove,
      so several people will have rushed to The City Of The Dead to find out
      what happened. Several will appear concerned for the parties safety. All
      that shall remain of the structure are the stone steps which will have
      cracked and and crumbled. They will have crumbled so much as to reveal a
      nook on a lower level that was previously buried beneath the dirt. In this
      small nook is a stone chest where offerings were once placed for the
      mighty Ouroboros.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening the chest reveals a bounty of 225 gold pieces, a golden holy
      symbol with the Ouroboros etching (25 gp value), and four random gemstones
      worth 10 gp each.

      Returning to Gullet Cove will reveal a day like any other, people continue
      to go about their day as if nothing had happened. Several of the townsfolk
      do appear to be talking about the incident at the graveyard, but most seem
      oblivious. A few people do keep talking about the storm a few days out at
      see. The more you look, the more it does seem to trouble you.
