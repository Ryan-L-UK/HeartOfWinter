    <p>
      Two Temple Wizards of Thay have undertaken a secret mission into the
      Fairheight Range east of the Sword Coast. They are searching for something
      or someone. Whatever their goal out there in the cold and windswept
      mountains, if the Temple Wizards want to keep it secret then it is
      probably best uncovered swiftly for the good of everyone else. Even the
      mercenaries who escorted them into the wilderness earlier agree: someone
      should stop them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursuing the Temple Wizards leads the adventurers to a Flame Crevasse deep
      in the mountains of the Fairheight Range. At the Flame Crevasse, they
      discover the remnants of a wizards' sanctum still being plundered. The
      fate of its lore and treasures is up to the characters. Without caution,
      things may get out of hand.
    </p>
    <h2 id="some-history">Some History</h2>
    <p>
      A lone wizard roams the land. He is a visitor from another world. He has
      come to the Sword Coast in pursuit of legends, lore and to inflict evil
      and on the realm. He is called <strong>Nihilus</strong>, though few here
      know him by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      His explorations caught the attention of the Temple of Virtuous
      Probability, who dispatched a pair of their own wizards to find the roving
      caster. These searchers <strong>Morwena</strong> and her apprentice,
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Malivar.png"
          >Malivar</a
        ></strong
      >, tracked the wizard to the Fairheight Range east of the Sword Coast.
      They surmised (correctly) that their quarry was looking for a site of
      arcane power.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find their way through the Fairheight Range and stay on Nihiluss's
      trail, the Temple Wizards hired local mercenaries to guide them, led by a
      former bandit called Lothar.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Temple Wizards drew close to their target at a site colloquially
      called the Flame Crevasse, Lothar and his mercenaries abandoned the whole
      enterprise out of fear. They fled back to the village of Grayvale, on the
      edge of the Fairheight Range, where they tell anyone who will listen that
      bad things are afoot out at the Flame Crevasse now. &quot;Wizards hunting
      wizards can lead to no good,&quot; Lothar says.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-story-at-the-flame-crevasse">
      The Story at the Flame Crevasse
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Flame Crevasse started as a proper Flame Crevasse and stood quietly in
      the Fairheight Range for centuries before a sect of wizards moved in,
      plundered it for treasure, discarded the dead inside the Flame Crevasse,
      and used their magic to reshape the place into a remote lair. For years,
      the wizards used this place as a sanctum, laboratory, library, and
      eventually a tomb for members of their small order. Whatever became of the
      final members of the order, they never returned to this place.
    </p>
    <p>For decades, it stood quietly.</p>
    <p>
      Then, a few days ago, <strong>Nihilus</strong> arrived with elementals in
      his service. The elementals dug into the ground near the Flame Crevasse to
      get access to its lowest reaches. That created the sinkhole just east of
      the Flame Crevasse, into area 15. From there, <strong>Nihilus</strong> and
      his minions stormed the library in area 14.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two days, <strong>Nihilus</strong> searched the library for items of
      value. When <strong>Morwena</strong> and
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Malivar.png"
          >Malivar</a
        ></strong
      >
      arrived, they confronted him in a brief skirmish of spells before choosing
      to parley.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Morwena</strong>, intrigued by the roving wizard and hungry for
      the power he offered, chose to abandon her mission and join
      <strong>Nihilus</strong>.
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Malivar.png"
          >Malivar</a
        ></strong
      >
      thought it was a trick. It wasn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Malivar.png"
          >Malivar</a
        ></strong
      >, afraid and heartbroken, threatened them both but was no match for
      either. Struck by <strong>Nihilus</strong>'s spells, he fled the library,
      deeper into the Flame Crevasse, and collapsed on the verge of death. (He
      is likely still in area 13 when the adventurers arrive.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Morwena</strong> suggested they let
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Malivar.png"
          >Malivar</a
        ></strong
      >
      go, as she wasn't worried about reprisal from the Temple Wizards anymore.
      She and her new ally teleported away with their treasures, leaving the
      elemental minions to close up the Flame Crevasse again and burn the
      library to cover their master's tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lead minion, a fire spirit called

      the library to burn them but has stopped to read all he can before he
      destroys them.
    </p>
    <h1 id="part-1-the-village-of-grayvale">Part 1: The Village of Grayvale</h1>
    <p>
      The village of Grayvale sits with its back against a riverside cliff made
      of pink granite. The village centre is mostly modest cottages and shops,
      with homes and farms lining the roads out of town and the top of the
      cliffs overlooking Hark River. Across the water, green hills rise to
      become the Fairheight Range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever brings the characters to Grayvale, they hear word of Lothar and
      his party's recent return from the Fairheight Range. Whether he drinks
      nearby or tells his story out on the street, Lothar brags about how lucky
      he and his crew are to be alive &quot;after almost being murdered by
      Wizards.&quot;
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-tavern">The Tavern</h2>
    <p>
      The Wailing Mountains is a large building, with the rather filthy bar
      occupying the ground floor, and the beds for patrons are on the floor
      directly above you. It's poorly lit. The tables of the tavern have been
      painted an auburn colour and only have a few knicks and scratches. The few
      people that are in the tavern bear scars, and openly talk of their violent
      exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the counter is who you would assume to be the bartender, a young
      adult female gnome with fingers like sausages who is currently taking an
      order from a customer. You walk up to the bar, and strike up conversation
      with the woman, who introduces herself as Aodreia Layne, the acting
      manager of The Wailing Mountains.

        thought they gave up them, and the ability to talk when they signed up
        to whatever temple rubbish they believe. Anyway
        <strong>Morewena</strong> used to be her apprentice and she still puts
        him in his place, you know? He doesn't like it.&quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        &quot;<strong>Morwena</strong>, she said the Flame Crevasse they were
        looking for might contain great treasure. She seemed to doubt it was a
        Flame Crevasse at all, though. She called it a 'sanctum.' Not sure I
        agree with that to be honest with you.&quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        &quot;She maybe meant the Flame Crevasse, which was used for strange
        rites for decades, but apparently it was never opened.&quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        &quot;Anyway, them Temple Wizards, they're chasing someone. Another
        wizard, from a rival group, maybe? Sounded like they wanted them
        alive.&quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        &quot;We made good time, crossing the hills. I know good trails. But one
        night, <strong>Morwena</strong> told

        she didn't think they needed guides anymore. So, we left, before they
        could kill us.&quot;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Lothar can point the way to the Flame Crevasse: it is a mere 6-hour hike
      into the Fairheight Range, about 18 miles Northeast of Grayvale.
    </p>
    <h1 id="part-2-the-flame-crevasse">Part 2: The Flame Crevasse</h1>
    <p>
      After several hours of hard climbing, you arrive at the entrance to the
      Flame Crevasse. Located in the side of a mountain, the entrance is marked
      by two tall standing stones, each etched with faded spiral sigils. The
      entrance is a weather-worn set of stairs interrupted by an upright stone
      slab. It was never a door, but a seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Morwena</strong> and
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Malivar.png"

        ></strong
      >
      forced the seal open when they arrived. Now the Flame Crevasse stands open
      to the winds and gathering rains of the Fairheight Range. Anyone can
      descend the steep, worn steps and enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the adventurers arrive, the Flame Crevasse has already been entered
      (twice) and partly plundered.
    </p>
    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    <p>
      After its origins as a Flame Crevasse grave in ancient times, the interior
      of the Flame Crevasse has been refashioned with magic and more modern
      crafting techniques. It is also evident that this Flame Crevasse has been
      expanded as time has gone on. The top level remains the oldest in fashion,
      combining original stone slabs with mortar and stones from about a century
      ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second and third levels of the site consist of grey, cut stones slowly
      giving way after decades without maintenance, made all the worse by side
      effects of the sinkhole opening up outside. Cracks and gaps now reach into
      the second level of the site. Some areas are in danger of collapsing into
      the library below. Clever adventurers may find a way to take advantage of
      these dangers; others may succumb to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ceilings</strong> Each level features rough, uneven ceilings about
      8 feet high, left unfinished for cosmetic effect by the wizards of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Doors</strong> On the first level, doors are ramshackle, rotten
      things, lightweight and easily opened or broken. Except where otherwise
      noted, doors of the lower two levels are sturdy but small for their
      frames, unlikely to stick in place even after all these years.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Light</strong> The first level has no usable, surviving light
      sources. The second and third levels feature periodic wall sconces housing
      glassy stones magically enchanted to give off dim light. Most of them
      still work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sound</strong> The Flame Crevasse would be silent if not for
      intruders. Since the sinkhole damaged the site, sound now carries from the
      second level to the third where the floors are cracked and giving way.

    <h3 id="b1-guard-chamber">B1: Guard Chamber</h3>
    <p>
      The wizards meant for this chamber to be a guard post, but rather than
      bring people out here who weren't wizards in their little sect, they later
      opted to trap the chamber with an experimental magic glyph. (The wizards
      mostly came and went by teleportation circles in the library anyway.)
    </p>
    <em>
      The winds and the chill from outside make their way into this chamber. The
      remains of wooden stools and a rack of rotten spears suggest this was a
      guard station once. A squat stele, about three feet tall, stands in the
      centre of the chamber now, marked with a single, deeply etched glyph of
      bright blue. A silver medallion hangs from the top of the stele, partly
      blocking the glyph.
    </em>
    <p>
      The stele is marked with a glyph akin to a glyph of warding, but it
      differs in important ways. Several of these trapped steles can be found
      throughout the Flame Crevasse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wooden scraps or detritus in this chamber catch fire if the trap goes off,
      but the fire has nowhere to spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      The medallion was set on the stele long ago to prevent its trap from going
      off. The trap cannot see around the medallion. Removing the medallion
      makes the stele's trap active again, though whoever wears or carries the
      medallion does not trigger the trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Morwena</strong> and
      <strong
        ><a href="http://localhost:8080/Sources/Creatures/Malivar.png"
          >Malivar</a
        ></strong
      >
      ignored the stele and the medallion in their rush to reach the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Trapped Steles</strong>The Flame Crevasse's trapped steles were
      crafted with effects not unlike a glyph of warding. However, the steles'
      glyphs are plain to see even in dim light. Each trapped stele can be
      activated multiple times; exactly how many depends on the individual
      stele. When the stele detects a trespasser in front of its glyph it
      immediately emits a stroke of lightning at the trespasser. If a targeted
      trespasser does not leave the area, the stele emits lightning again on
      initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties).
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone not named when the stele was crafted is considered a trespasser
      unless they wear or carry a medallion of safe passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Guard Chamber Trapped Stele.</strong> This trapped stele detects
      trespassers in a 30-foot cone in front of its glyph. It has a passive
      Perception score of 18. To disarm or dispel the trap requires a successful
      DC 18 check. Any creature that triggers the trap and fails a DC 15
      Dexterity saving throw takes (4d10) lightning damage, or half as much
      damage with a successful save.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn
      or carried. This stele can emit lightning a total of five times before
      becoming nothing more than inert stone.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Medallion of Safe Passage</strong> The medallion is silver-plated
      copper engraved with the same glyph as the stele, so the medallion appears
      coppery. Any creature wearing or visibly carrying one of these medallions
      does not trigger a trapped stele. The medallion is not magical. It is
      simply recognized by the steles, throughout the Flame Crevasse, granting
      safe passage past their traps.

      A few open crates, rotten sacks of grain, and scattered heaps of straw

      Ornately woven red rugs cover much of the uneven floor of this chamber,
      held down by deep, leather chairs and a split, collapsed table. One wall
      boasts a gold painted frame and a smoke-darkened painting of Sword Coast
      cliffs. The sideboard practically bows from the weight of silver goblets,
      tea pots, and more.

    <p>
      This chamber was once a common room and dining area for the site. The
      furnishings that once made it comfortable are still here, caked with dust,
      damp, and debris.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Treasure.</strong> The silver wares, tea pots, and serving trays
      here are collectively worth 310 sp. The landscape painting is a lost work
      by a beloved Waterdhavian artist named Saraque Skyhill worth 1,200 sp if
      properly conserved.

    <em>
      The air in here is damp and chill. It smells like hay left to rot.
    </em>
    <p>
      Each of these chambers was a private room for a member of the sect who
      visited or worked on site regularly. Personal effects have mostly been
      removed, leaving these feeling more like cells than bedrooms. Forgotten
      bedrolls and empty, unlocked chests are all that remain in most rooms.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>B4A: Hidden Shrine</strong> This chamber hides a secret door
      leading to a hidden shrine. The secret door is little more than a hatch
      behind this room's empty chest, hidden by dried mud and a slab meant to
      look like part of the wall. The door can be spotted with a DC 13
      Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check or passive
      score.
    </p>
    <em>
      A little stone altar just two feet wide stands here buried in black dirt
      at the foot of a narrow chimney that seems to have fallen in. Something
      glints amid the dirt.
    </em>
    <p>
      The hidden shrine itself is half-buried in dirt and loam at the bottom of
      a once-empty chimney, meant to allow the shrine to see the stars. Whatever
      deity was once honoured here, all that remains are melted candles, 1 sp,
      and a medallion of safe passage.
    </p>
    <h3 id="b5-ceremonial-entryway">B5: Ceremonial Entryway</h3>
    <p>
      The north, east, and west walls are made of plaster adorned with colourful
      but smoke-faded murals. Each mural depicts figures in stark robes—some
      red, some green, some blue—painted as if they are part of a procession
      carrying trays of fire, lit incense, and silver toward the doorway to area
      6.
    </p>
    <em>
      Murals along three walls portray figures in bright robes of green or red
      or blue marching in file through an abstract environment suggesting
      perhaps a bright garden and stained glass. These figures are all human in
      size but depicted in various fashions and styles beneath their robes. The
      south wall is bare, unfinished slabs of stone, marking the original outer
      edge of the Flame Crevasse.
    </em>
    <p>
      The secret door to area 7 is a narrow wooden section hidden under the
      plaster, decorated by a figure in green robes with one hand over his eyes.
      The door can be found with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)
      or Wisdom (Perception) check.
    </p>
    <h3 id="b6-descent-passage">B6: Descent Passage</h3>
    <p>
      The painted plaster walls continue into this area, depicting robed wizards
      headed toward the stairs down to area 8. But here, the wizards' robes are
      multi-coloured.
    </p>
    <em>
      The robed figures on these walls wear detailed, multi-coloured robes with
      cuffs and hems adorned with magic words and sigils. Some of these figures
      wear long beards or long braids; others are clad in buckled bands of
      leather and sleek leggings. Each one is depicted carrying treasures or
      offerings toward the stairs that descend deeper ahead.
    </em>
    <p>
      The stairs down to the second level mark the start of the finer, more
      modern stonework of the site's lower two levels.
    </p>
    <h3 id="b7-observers-chamber">B7: Observer's Chamber</h3>
    <p>
      Wizards used this chamber to observe newcomers to the sect as they
      performed rites and recited chants in the ceremonial entryway (area 5) and
      descended the stairs (area 6).
    </p>
    <em>
      From inside, the northern and eastern walls of this room appear
      translucent, though hazy and smeared, like peering through rainy glass.
    </em>
    <p>
      The walls are quite solid to the touch. Anyone in this room can focus
      their attention to see and hear into areas 5 and 6. The passive Perception
      scores of creatures in this chamber suffer a–5 penalty while observing the
      adjoining chambers.

      These passages of fitted stone blocks are sturdy and intact throughout
      much of the second level—but not all of it. Between the ritual chambers
      (areas 10, 11, and 12), the floor has been shaken and cracked by side
      effects from the sinkhole collapse nearby. Everything in area 8 is capable

      in the grand library below (area 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures in area 14 have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to
      peer up into this area and a (-5) penalty to passive Perception to idly
      notice things in this area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adventurers attempting to observe the grand library through the flooring
      here also have disadvantage on their checks, unless they get down on the
      floor to peer through gaps.

    <h3 id="b9-component-vault">B9: Component Vault</h3>
    <em>
      This sturdy wooden door, bound in iron straps and hinges, has stood strong
      against the passage of time.
    </em>
    <p>
      This door is locked (DC 16 to pick the lock) and well built (Strength DC
      20 to break it down) but the chamber's primary defence is the trapped
      stele inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Vault Stele.</strong> This trapped stele detects trespassers it
      can see in a 60-foot cone in front of its glyph. It has a passive
      Perception score of 16. To disarm or dispel the trap requires a successful
      DC 16 check. Any creature that triggers the trap and fails a DC 15
      Dexterity saving throw takes (4d10) lightning damage, or half as much
      damage with a successful save.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn
      or carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stele can emit lightning a total of three times before becoming
      nothing more than inert stone. Beyond the stele, this place is a kind of
      arcane pantry.
    </p>
    <em>
      This chamber houses clay urns, glass jars, and wooden boxes arranged
      haphazardly on wall-mounted shelves and caked in years of dust.
    </em>
    <h4 id="treasure">Treasure</h4>
    <p>
      These containers once held spell components. Most have been carried off or
      have rotted away, but one urn still holds 44 sp worth of diamond dust and
      a wooden box contains a coil of gold twine almost 3 feet long, worth 29
      sp. A medallion of safe passage hangs from a hook on the southern wall.
    </p>
    <em>
      <h4 id="collapsing-floors">Collapsing Floors</h4>
      <p>
        The floors in areas 10, 11, and 12 are precarious. For every 20 feet of
        movement across these floors by a creature bearing more than 100 pounds
        (including itself), there is a 25 percent chance that the floor groans
        and crumbles away into area 14. If a trapped stele activates in these
        areas, there is a 50 percent chance the floor immediately collapses.
      </p>
      <p>
        A successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check allows someone to collapse
        the floor intentionally. A crowbar or other leverage grants advantage on
        the check.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creatures in or beneath the area when the floor collapses must attempt a
        DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a
        failure, or half as much on a success. A creature that succeeds on the
        saving throw within 5 feet of the walls can choose to cling to the
        nearest wall to avoid damage and a fall. Otherwise, any creature in this
        area when the floor gives way tumbles down into area 14.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Falling Steles.</strong> Any trapped stele that tumbles into
        area 14 survives the fall and continues to function normally. The DM
        decides the facing of such steles; they may fire into area 14 or up into
        other areas, depending on how they land.

      The floor is etched deep with overlapping geometries, but much of the

    <p>
      Wizards used this chamber to cast ritual spells without distraction, to
      perform rites sacred to the old sect, and to observe apprentices as they
      practiced their work.

    <p>
      Any checks to sneak through this chamber without attracting the attention

    <p>
      The etchings along the wall are instructions for casting detect magic and

    <p>
      This used to be a laboratory, but aside from the heavy tables, shelves,

      <strong>Laboratory Steles.</strong> These two trapped steles detect
      trespassers they can see in 60-foot cones in front of their glyphs. Each

      requires a successful DC 15 check. Any creature that triggers the trap and
      fails a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw takes (4d10) lightning damage, or
      half as much damage with a successful save. The lightning ignites
      flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

      If he knows intruders are present, he summons an elemental to defend

      <strong>Teleportation Circles.</strong> Two teleportation circles used to
      serve this chamber and the wizards who kept this collection. The northern
      circle has been damaged by the sinkhole's collapse. (It used to lead to a
      now-ruined wizard's tower overlooking the Sword Coast.) The southern
      circle leads to an abandoned townhouse in Waterdeep; the circle there is
      beneath the floorboards in the attic. (See &quot;Part 3: What's

      <strong>Treasure.</strong> To historians, sages, and collectors in a
      college or university, the value of the library's nonmagical collection is
      up to 550 sp. Three spell scrolls also remain in the collection: one
      scroll of

    <h4 id="the-burning-library">The Burning Library</h4>
    <p>
      In this library—littered with stray pages, tables, chairs, and rugs—fire
      spreads 5 feet in any direction on initiative count 20 (losing initiative
      ties), as sheets of fiery paper flit about on fire-hot winds. Each 5-foot
      square that is burning deals (1d6) fire damage to the library, to a
      maximum of (12d6) fire damage each turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      A creature that starts its turn in a burning space takes (1d6) fire
      damage. A creature without resistance to fire damage has disadvantage on
      Wisdom (Perception) checks to see through the smoke and fire here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chamber survives the fire even if it is a charred husk billowing smoke
      into upper levels and into area 15 and the open air.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the collection that's in jeopardy. The library collection has 300
      hit points and no damage threshold. Consult the Collection Damage Results
      table to determine what survives based on damage suffered by the
      collection.
    </p>
    <h4 id="fighting-the-fire">Fighting the Fire</h4>
    <p>
      What the adventurers use to combat the flames is up to them. Water is not
      plentiful here, but earth and dirt are in great supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presume any ability check to put out fire by nonmagical means requires a
      successful DC 15 check, the ability of which depends on what the
      characters are trying to do. Success on such a check puts out fire in a
      10-foot square or equivalent area.
    </p>
    <p>
      If cold damage caused in any 5-foot-square area exceeds the damage being
      dealt in that area by the blaze, that 5-foot square's fire goes out.
      Persistent ice or other lingering effects keep fire from spreading.

        choices might well make things easier or more difficult for them—that's
        fair. All these moving parts are here to create options and unexpected
        interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If circumstances do turn against the adventurers, it can be dire.
        Depending on the monsters involved, a battle in the library can become
        an encounter of Deadly magnitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that defeating the adventurers isn't a goal of the NPCs or
        monsters here. Combat isn't an essential outcome. Anyone might be driven
        to flee if things go sideways—even the elementals. If the library burns
        to ash, then it does.

      Bits of curved marble and stone discs that used to form columns suggest a
      place that was important once. Now it is smashed to ruin.
      <br />
      <br />
      Some of the stones move about on their own, picking through the rubble.
    </em>
    <p>
      This wide passage was once a memorial site of grey stone and white marble
      details. The arrival of <strong>Nihilus</strong> and his elementals
      shattered the columns, arches, and mosaics. All that remains are drab
      heaps of stone dotted with bits of tile and marble. The floor is
      essentially a pit of rubble now, gathering soil, rocks, and grasses from
      the sinkhole collapse all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      This whole area is difficult terrain. The doors to area 14 are loose on
      their hinges and blocked by a slab of stone that keeps them from opening.
      <strong>Nihilus</strong> didn't want to be followed. The stone requires a
      successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to move aside or a successful
      DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to wiggle past.
    </p>
    <p>
      This area is inhabited for now by two earth elementals lingering here
      after helping <strong>Nihilus</strong> reach this place. They are not
      afraid to engage in combat, but neither is willing to die here. They flee
      into the earth if reduced to 25 percent of their hit points, possibly to
      return days later for further exploring.

    <h3 id="b16-honoured-crypts">B16: Honoured Crypts</h3>
    <p>
      The ceremonial hall was meant to end in a fresco depicting a starry sky,
      the moon, and its tail. Much of that fresco has fallen away with
      <strong>Nihilus</strong>'s arrival, revealing bare, grey stone underneath.
      A wall that hides a door, which was never meant to be opened. A successful
      DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check reveals
      the door amid the rubble.
    </p>
    <em>
      The grey, unadorned passage beyond the fresco hangs with an eerie, dusty
      fog.
    </em>
    <p>
      The passage and crypts beyond the door are simple and spare. The
      sarcophagi in areas 16A through 16D are simply carved to depict the
      various, forgotten wizards inside. No grandeur. Each is depicted in a
      simple robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, some of the dead wizards interred in these crypts, stirred by anger
      and unrest, rise to defend the crypts. These 1d4 + 2

      means the adventurers, elementals,

      within 100 feet of the crypts' secret door, returning as necessary to
      drive off intruders. They do not seal themselves in and do not open the
      door of their own accord.

    <p>
      <strong>Treasure.</strong> The crypts are fairly sparely appointed, as the
      wizards interred here left their belongings to the library and their
      apprentices. Still, a few silver vases, golden urns, and goblets,
      altogether worth 30 sp, can be found here. Area 16C includes a small
      obsidian statue of a medusa with emerald eyes worth 42 sp.

      The adventurers may have treasure to sell and lore to lend, or questions
      in mind and wounds to tend. The aftermath of this adventure is a bundle of
      questions, so focus on the characters and what they want to do next,
      perhaps with downtime activities. If they want to chase down
      <strong>Nihilus</strong> and <strong>Morwena</strong>, that trail might
      simply go cold—for now. Their threads reappear in the next adventure: The

      Gifting or selling the library's remains, and any other treasures, might
      occupy the adventurers until the next adventure. The Flame Crevasse, or
      what's left of it, might be of interest to sages—or the adventurers might
      keep it for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Investigations into the identities and fates of the Flame Crevasse wizards
      doesn't reveal tremendous secrets but neither does it yield many answers.
      The following items of lore are important for the next adventure, but much
      about those old wizards is left for you to decide, customize, or leave in
      mystery.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The leader of the Flame Crevasse wizards' sect was a traveller from
        &quot;a faraway place&quot; or &quot;a distant world.&quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        She came to the Sword Coast &quot;looking for answers&quot; and to
        &quot;study the magic of the Realms.&quot; Her followers were scholarly
        wizards.
      </li>
      <li>
        She lived in a townhouse in Waterdeep sometimes, but left it walled up
        when she returned to her homeland. The sect fell apart without her.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Teleportation Circles.</strong> The teleportation circles in the
      library led to places helpful for the wizards' sect. One led to the attic
      of the master's boarded-up, derelict townhouse. The other is damaged and
      presumably not working—or you can use it to plug into your campaign
      elsewhere.
