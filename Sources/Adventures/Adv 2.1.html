        An inspection of the cat nip will find that it has been cut with both
        Poinsettia &amp; Variety of lily’s.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is also evident this this catnip, before being cut would offer better

    <h2 id="the-tent">The Tent</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The market area has been covered with a giant tent which spans the
        entire market place. A multicoloured magic fabric sparkles and lights
        the inside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Looking up from the inside, the entire top of the tent is bewitched with
        a variety of magical effects and lights. It looks like the night sky
        with dancing lights, sparkles and magical fireworks cascading through
        the air.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inside the regular market stalls can be found, along with some new and
        exciting ones.

            A few shops are sadly closed, and it would appear they have been for
            some time, the recession has hit hard everywhere. Some of the names
            do catch your eye. ‘The Screaming Hog’, ‘The Calm Train’ &amp;
            ‘Florist Gump’ to name a few.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="the-main-event">The Main Event</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Several cages can be seen, they are partially covered with a black sheet
        but you can see in side and they appear empty. There are LOTS of guards
        blocking the way with a staff only sign, and instructions that no one is
        to go on the stage unless they are the guest of honour himself.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before players try to enter the pet shop secret location. The guest of
        honour will arrive on his dog and there will be the big cheer and a lot
        of excitement.
      </li>
      <li>
        He will walk onto the stage and dismount the dog who will sit at
        attention off to the side.
      </li>
      <li>
        There will be a big charismatic speech of the journey through the many
        seas. He will talk of the struggles, the days that went by where urine
        was the only drink they had. Essentially tales of torment and woe. Until
        at last they landed on a new island, inhabited by a brand new species.
      </li>
      <li>
        Like David Copperfield, there will be the big reveal as the cloaks are
        draped back over the three large cages and with some magical sparks, the
        cloaks will be removed to reveal three cages one with a fully grown
        Tabaxi, another with an Aarakocra and the third with a Harengon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gasps and oohs will be heard from the audience, along with protests from
        the respective animals.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="the-ship-the-serpents-cry">The Ship (The Serpent’s Cry)</h2>
    <h4 id="the-crew-in-general">The Crew In General</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Most of the crew will be ashore at this point. What crew remain appear
        to be the unlucky few who need to stay and man the ship ensuring she is
        ready to go at a moments notice.
      </li>
      <li>
        They will appear pleased to be in port, but upset they will miss the
        celebrations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Advise the captain can be found in his cabin, but warn that he can be a
        little, much.
      </li>
      <li>
        They will also advise of the bonus he gave all the crew for their hard
        work on this voyage, and that most of the crew have gone ashore, no
        doubt most will return penniless.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="the-captains-cabin">The Captains Cabin</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Upon knocking there will be a lot of barking.</li>
      <li>
        Monsieur Le-Furr (Le-Fair) can be found sat behind his chair at his
        desk, quill in hand counting coins with the first mate.
      </li>
      <li>
        He is a fat white cat with a pair of black spots around his eyes. His
        hat is huge, with a giant feather. He looks over a set of crescent moon
        glasses perched upon the end of his nose. With the most ornate purple
        captains jacket you have ever seen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Glenn is a pretty normal looking human, a little smaller than average.
        His eyes bloodshot as if he hasn’t slept in a while, but overall in fair
        shape. Whilst he may not be the captain, you would be willing to bet he
        has done a fair amount of work as the captain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sir Barks-A-Lot is a tall, non-awakened Doberman, with a look constant
        stern look and a serious case of resting ‘I will fuck you up’ face.
      </li>
      <li>
        He will instruct that all loyal fans should away him at the tent for the
        celebrations.
      </li>
      <li>
        If questioned on the death of his crew member, he will just suggest they
        clearly done too much of stuff they shouldn’t, and that there is nothing
        wrong with their goods, and to stop spreading false rumours.
        <ul>
          <li>
            He will provide a small sample he has stashed in his office for
            later, and it will be perfectly fine and not tampered with.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        If there is nothing else, they should go to the tent he will be along
        shortly for the celebrations as he has a big surprise for everyone. A
        new species has been discovered.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="the-drug-fuel">The Drug Fuel</h1>
    <h2 id="murder-on-the-docks">Murder On The Docks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A fat gnome will be found on the dock by the harbourmaster. He is the
        Harbourmasters assistant and you remember him from your arrival looking
        a little, shady. But given some people just have that look, you paid him
        no real attention.
      </li>
      <li>
        He is dead and with foam coming from the mouth. His face quite puffy,
        although given his stature its hard to say if that’s the cause of death,
        or just one too many doughnuts.
      </li>
      <li>
        On his body you will find a note in his pocket, as well as a small coin
        pouch with 2 gold coins in it, all covered in a curious dust. What ever
        poison was on this page was slow acting enough that he likely didn’t
        know he was poisoned until it was too late.
      </li>
      <li>
        The note is from the cunning man advising of the fact that the cut was
        meant to make animals a little more menial, not a little more dead. That
        he has displeased the cunning man, and that he will pay the price.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the back will be the faint writing of an old closed up shop in the
        market place. ‘The Calm Train’
      </li>
      <li>
        A closer look of the man will also reveal a death certificate for a dog,
        and on the other side, a note written and signed by the dog.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="the-calm-train">The Calm Train</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Will be closed up tight and there will be a sign saying out of business
        on the door. The paper looks similar to that of the note you have. There
        is a further sign saying deliveries round the back.
      </li>
      <li>
        A very flimsy looking door is round the back which is unlocked and entry
        is granted easily to a back room of the establishment.
      </li>
      <li>
        The smell of old tobacco and smokable cat nip fills your lungs. You
        start to understand where the name ‘Calm Train’ came from.
      </li>
      <li>
        After a short look around, a cupboard will reveal a stair way down
        underneath the calm train. An initial glance at the walls suggest that
        this is a feature added after the closure of the Calm Train. The tunnel
        has been carved out of the rock by hand and would have taken a fair
        amount of time. So whoever has done this, clearly had a good reason too.
      </li>
      <li>
        The tunnel appears to have been carved from the very rock itself, fairly
        recently. There are no stairs, simple a slope tunnel down.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="the-pet-shop-1">The Pet Shop</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The tunnel is dark, reducing visibility to 5 feet.</li>
      <li>
        DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check enables the player characters to hear a
        heated conversation ahead of them, where the darkness of the tunnel is
        replaced by a glint of light.
      </li>
      <li>
        One of the voices is raging, demanding immediate violence. The other is
        calming and is attempting to ask the first voice to be calm and to trust
        him.
      </li>
      <li>
        You see two figures leave the bar area at the bottom of the stars. A
        tall well-built human and a small dwarf.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the central room and auction is taking place with over 30 various
        clients all sat in the tables being served drinks by waiters and
        waitresses in rather revealing attire.
      </li>
      <li>
        The clients appear to be a variety of races, however none appear
        awakened animals. The are all dressed in amazingly fabulous attire,
        however each wears a ornate and elaborate mask. The mask covers their
        whole head and each appears to be a different mythical creature.
      </li>
      <li>
        The bidding will begin on a rather small scared looking puppy, and there
        will be low numbers, 2’s, 3’s &amp; 4’s. It is actually in the hundreds
        of gold pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Four goblin guards are stationed at various points around the main cave,
        with one behind the bar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inside the cage A large dog can be seen, the father of the puppy up for
        auction, as well as two small cats. All appear visibly distressed and
        not happy to be here. The dog holds on to the ‘death certificate’ of his
        wife.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>A Fight Breaks Out</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As soon as combat is looming, the Cunning Man will announce loudly:
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        My deepest apologies, we will have to forgo todays sales. Please brace
        for immediate departure
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The goblin behind the bar can be seen smashing a piece of glass covering
        some form of button. Once this button is pressed, what appears to be an
        arcane liquid is dropped from the ceiling upon each of the clients. The
        moment it touches them they immediately blink out of existence.
      </li>
      <li>
        The cunning man will make a leaping dive to the nearest one to also make
        his escape, leaving behind Requin. The random person will appear
        disgusted at being touched by the Cunning Man.
      </li>
      <li>
        Requin won’t flee, no matter the circumstances. He fights with reckless
        abandon, enjoying himself intensely. He will also turn into his
        wereshark almost instantly. The goblins provide support to the
        wereshark, but he leads the combat, snapping at the player characters
        with his vast jaws or bludgeoning them with the anchor he carries
        everywhere.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upon his defeat he does need to be stabbed with something silver
        ideally, if the party have worked that out. If not, he may come back at
        a later date, who is to say.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upon his death he will return to a (dead) version of his human form.
      </li>

        Inside a book, a page will be marked. Entirely blank, except these
        words:
      </li>
      <li>
        The Lord of Murder shall perish. But in his doom he shall spawn a score
        of mortal progeny. Chaos will be sown from their passing, So sayeth the
        wise Alaundo.
      </li>
      <li>
        A check will reveal knowledge that Alaundo was a seer many years ago in
        the sword coast, but he is known to have travelled the world, it seems
        only plausible that his work would have made its way here.

        of the animals to explain their disappearance.

        The stalls will be there, although given the lack of custom, most will
        also be closing up at this point.

        But this is not the end of the merriment. A short while later a canon
        shot can be heard. It would appear that your companion, Kerwyn (Kirsty),
        headed back to the ship, freed the three captives and they have taken it
        upon themselves to get some revenge. By shooting canons at the Serpents
        Cry.

      <li>
        The ship would appear to have made a somewhat of a hasty exit to the
        sea, however it is now under fire from one of the larger and more
        special of the of the cannons on the edge of the harbour.

      <li>Little more in here can be found than general store of stock.</li>

        Hidden behind one of the crates on the upper story however is a small
        barrel of catnip, along with a bag of what appears to be, various
        poisons. This is clearly where the gnome was blending the Narcotics with
        something more sinister.

        Manned by a skeleton crew, but still enough to make way. There are
        various people on and around the ship
        <ul>
          <li>
            Monseur LeFurr is in his cabin. He is initially shouting at Glenn
            before banishing him.
          </li>
          <li>Glenn will leave the captains quarters before heading down</li>
          <li>
            Below decks two crew members will be seen patrolling the cannons.
            Dainard 'Brown-eyes' Acton &amp; Wiley 'Dead Eyes' Blakemore
          </li>
          <li>
            Down in the bilge at the bottom will be the three cages and a single
            half-orc on guard. She will be asleep, with the keys in hand. Nex.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        You can escape be incapacitating all the guards, you can escape through
        one of the canon port holes. You can also escape by fighting your way
        out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Potentially spotted by the lookout on the ship, depending on the
        stealth.
        <ul>
          <li>If spotted the captain will be notified</li>
          <li>He will come on deck to find crew in various conditions.</li>
          <li>
            Glenn will try to hide as he knows he will get beaten for this.

        The Triple gun is one of Timorys prized ideas and comprised of three
        large cannons mounted on a rotating gearing system. Once fired, the
        cannon recoils and the gearing automatically rotates to the next. This
        allows the spend cannon to be reloaded whilst two shots remain
        chambered. Used to protect the harbour from Men-O-War, it would appear
        to be making mincemeat of the Serpents Cry.

        Ptolemeow (Aaron) Will very much like this design and im sure would love
        the opportunity to copy it.

        The harbour master will rush with 2 human members of the watch to stop
        them, however between the Aarakocra, is able to fend off the watch, who
        decide that this really isn’t worth their time, and much to the distress
        of the harbour master, walk off.
      </li>
      <li>
        The tabaxi will be casting spells like a trooper and monsieur lefurr
        will be fighting back. Check the character sheets for her stats.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can only imagine how upset this must be making Monsieur LeFurr.

      <li>Inside The Inn</li>
      <li>
        A little quieter inside, less sailers and nautical vibes than the
        previous night.
      </li>
      <li>
        A few people can talk about the random appearance of some dwarf who
        appeared out of thin air.
      </li>
      <li>
        They will say he looked concerned and shocked, but seemed to run off in
        the direction of some back streets.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If on the chance the party try searching for him, the smell will
            have gone by now thanks to the overwhelming smell of gunpowder.
          </li>
          <li>
            They will not there were lots of various routes and double backs to
            ensure he wasn’t followed.

        The scent of the room as you entered is unbelievable,<br />
        How I didn’t vomit on my lute, is inconceivable.<br />
        You think yourself wise to stand upon my stage,<br />
        But I have just started, consider a disengage.<br />
        Is there any cat nip in the house, for my friend, he looks nervous,<br />
        Although given his tiny stature, it’s a wonder he gets service.<br />
        My Friend, re-evaluate your life and your existence,<br />
        I bet you talk a good game, but can you go the distance…
