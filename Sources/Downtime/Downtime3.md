# Downtime

Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.
Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your DM.

> This 'Downtime' took place between Adventures 4.5 & 4.6

## Thorny

Is Gullet Cove a town or a city? Depending on how long it takes, I would like to use my downtime to sow rumours. Firstly, I would like to sow a rumour amongst the common folk that Thorny Brimblepot used their holy power to single-handedly bring down a foul demon and is a pure-hearted individual. If that rumour is successful and I have time, I would like to attempt to sow a second rumour that the person in charge of Gullet Cove is a kiddy fiddler. If I don't have time or if the first rumour is unsuccessful then I won't do the second one and instead would do some mercenary work.

Any little settlements within a day or two that are still ruled by whoever is in charge of Gullet that'd be easier to convince? Thorny's not in a huge rush so is happy to start small (Ulgoths Beard)

## Bens Character

Downtime plans:

- look for leads into Yavannas whereabouts
- have a drink with each member of the group if they are amenable to learn more about them
- visit the black market on one day. Dealers choice on which day
- shake the jesters bag once a day

## I guess my other goal would be to ingratiate myself with the local thrives again so if they have a job going that wouldn't take too long I'd probably do that. Assuming it's stealing from someone who deserves it

## Elvis

Visit Market 3 times
I will search for a rhythm maker’s drum

[20:49, 03/08/2023] Josh Bishop: That I’m simply the best musician in all the land. World famous and beloved by all.
[20:50, 03/08/2023] Josh Bishop: My performances at the inn should speak for themselves.

## Kerwyn

Kerwyn downtime plans: week 1: Head to my thieves guild, update them as to what other guild has been up to, re-establish contacts again, ask for update on finding my boy or man who took me. Update a few days retraining with dagger.
Weeks 2-3 (10 days) Performing sacred rights towards Raven Queen. I'd probably head to the local woods to do this as I don't believe I am aware of any temples dedicated to her. During these rights I'd like to spend time practicing ways I could dedicate my arcane spells to her Glory (probably sacrifice - aim to avoid Ceder just in case I run into her!!!)

When meeting with Ben's character: I was found in a box by a young boy and raised in the thieves guild until I was around a year old. Named Lord Kerwyn Lidda Tordek as the boy thought it sounded fancy, I remember he named me after famous thieves. After a particularly successful job I was dognapped by a crazy man and experimented on. He branded me with the XVIII on my leg to mark me as his 18th experiment. Something must have gone right as thereafter I was awakened and able to speak. He threw me out and I found my way back to Gullet Cove. I can't remember the name of my boy, whatever the experiment did, did something to my memory but I'm trying to find him. My Raven Queen is going to help me get revenge on the man who dognapped me. When I find him, his death shall be neither quick nor painless... and If I find he harmed my boy to steal me... well... I cant even imagine what I'll do to him...

## Ptolemeow

Hey Ryan, I was wondering if for my downtime I could change Ptolemeow up a bit - and change my race. I'd like to be an autognome (autocat?) - it wouldn't change that much besides my racial abilities, my stats might change by a point, but I'd still be the same size (small) and they take the shape of their creator so I could remain cat shaped. If that can happen I don't really mind what adventure Ptolemeow has to go on in his down time to shed his mortal flesh and become a pure and purrfect machine. Maybe it could involve the church of Gond and a big furnace, since he does like fire. I also have a phoenix feather I looted from some poor tree who clearly didn't stand back far enough, I don't know what it does exactly, but maybe it could be used in some ritual to bring ptolemeow back to life in a new body?

Ptolemeow would ask them if they wanted better arms, then spend the rest of the night drawing schematics for prosthetic flamethrower arms
