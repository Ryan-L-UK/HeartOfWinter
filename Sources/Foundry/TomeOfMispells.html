    <p>
      This magical tome appears to contain several spell scrolls. Each scroll
      can be used once per day, and regenerates daily at dawn. In reality, the
      spells are inscribed wrong, and their effects vary wildly from the
      intended. When one of these scrolls are used the DM reveals the spell's
      true effect.
    </p>
    <h2 id="spells">Spells</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Message / Massage.</strong> The target receives a pleasant back
      rub.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mage Armor / Mage Armoire.</strong> Summons a fancy wardrobe
      adjacent to the caster, containing three sets of clothes. Roll a 1d20
      three times. On a result of 1, the clothes are common quality. On a result
      of 2-10, the clothes are traveler's quality. On a result of 11-15, the
      clothes are costume quality, on a result of 16-19, the clothes are fine
      quality. On a result of 20, the clothes are a magic set of robes, clothes
      or armor determined by the DM.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Hold Person / Fold Person.</strong> The target must succeed a
      Wisdom saving throw or be bent over backwards. On a failed save, the
      target takes 4d6 damage and is paralyzed for one round.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Speak With Dead / Speak With Dad.</strong> For one minute you can
      communicate telepathically with your father, regardless of whether they
      are dead or alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ice Storm / Ick Storm.</strong> Gross sludge rains down for one
      minute creating difficult terrain in a 20 foot radius.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Teleport / Telepoot.</strong> Creates a loud fart at the intended
      location.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Wish / Wash</strong> A wet sponge cleans you vigorously for one
      minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fireball / Friarball.</strong> Conjures and launches a clergyman
      at the target, dealing 8d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed Dexterity saving
      throw. The conjured friar is holding its knees and tumbles end over end
      while screaming religious platitudes during its flight, and lies still
      after hitting the target. It is a nonliving magical construct, and upon
      closer inspection, it appears to be made of painted wood and dyed cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Magic Missile/ Magic Rissole.</strong> Instead of missiles of
      force, shoots three delicious baked circular balls of minced meat or fish,
      enclosed in pastry or rolled in breadcrumbs.
